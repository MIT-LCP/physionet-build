# This file is used with the UNIX `make' command to create and install on-line
# versions of the WFDB Programmer's Guide, and also to print it. Before using
# this file for the first time, check that the site-specific variables below
# are appropriate for your system.

# The WFDB Programmer's Guide guide documents the WFDB library.  It contains
# both tutorial and reference material, with many examples, that will be useful
# if you wish to develop your own application programs for reading, analyzing,
# or creating digitized, optionally annotated, recordings of signals.

# The most recent version of this guide is always available on PhysioNet
# (follow the links from http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).
# Use any web browser to read it.

# If you have the necessary formatting software, the WFDB Programmer's Guide
# can be produced in a wide variety of formats from the sources in in this
# directory.  Here is a brief list of available formats and the commands needed
# to produce them:

# printed copy	'make wpg-book' (requires troff, texi2dvi, dvips, & a printer)
# Windows help	'make wpg.hlp'  (requires makertf and hcrtf) [1]
# HTML		'make wpg.html' (requires texi2html and perl)
# info		'make wpg.info' (requires makeinfo or GNU emacs) [2]
# PDF		'make wpg.pdf'  (requires texi2dvi)
# PostScript	'make wpg.ps'   (requires texi2dvi and dvips)

# [1] 'makertf' is open-source, from http://makertf.sourceforge.net/; see this
# page for links to 'hcrtf'.  Since these programs run only under MS-Windows,
# it is not possible to generate 'wpg.hlp' except under MS-Windows (but it's
# not useful to do so except under MS-Windows, either).

# [2] The info files get installed into INFODIR (see below), which must be in
# your INFOPATH.  Once they have been installed, browse the guide from info (or
# from emacs after typing C-h i to enter the info system), by selecting `WFDB
# library' from the top-level menu.  Note that `make wpg.info' adds an entry
# for the Guide to the top-level `info' file ($INFODIR/dir).  If you install a
# GNU emacs update, this entry may disappear; to restore it, simply `make
# wpg.info' again.

.SH NAME
pnwlogin \- provide direct access to PhysioNetWorks for WFDB applications
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpnwlogin\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpnwlogin\fR is a \fBbash\fR shell script that collects user credentials
needed to access files in PhysioNetWorks projects, and provides them to WFDB
applications.  It also provides convenience functions, including validation of
credentials and modification of the WFDB path (see \fBsetdb\fR(1)) for
convenient access to your private PhysioNetWorks projects as well as any
active (shared) projects to which you belong.
.PP
After prompting for your PhysioNetWorks user name and password, \fBpnwlogin\fR
starts a shell, making the login credentials available to any commands run
within the shell.  Applications that use WFDB library version 10.5.14 or later
and libcurl 7.12.0 or later can make use of these credentials automatically
with no modifications; you will not be prompted to enter them again while
running within \fBpnwlogin\fR's shell.  Exit from the shell by typing a
control-D or \fBexit\fR (as for any \fBbash\fR shell).  Your credentials are
never written to permanent storage, and \fBpnwlogin\fR's in-memory copy of them
is destroyed on exit.
.SS First-time use:
.PP
You must be a member of an active project, or you must have created a private
project, in order to use \fBpnwlogin\fR successfully.  You cannot \fIcreate\fR
a PhysioNetWorks account or join a PhysioNetWorks project using \fBpnwlogin\fR.
.PP
To get started, use your web browser to go to
\fBhttps://physionet.org/users/\fR, click on "Create account", and follow the
instructions.  The process can be completed in a minute or two.  Once you have
an account, you will need to join an active project (follow the links on your
PhysioNetWorks home page to visit the main pages of projects of interest for
further information), or create a private project before you will be able to
use \fBpnwlogin\fR.

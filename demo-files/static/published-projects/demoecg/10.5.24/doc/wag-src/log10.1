.TH LOG10 1 "30 July 2002" "WFDB 10.2.7" "WFDB Applications Guide"
.SH NAME
log10 \- calculate common logarithms of two-column data
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlog10\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBlog10\fR reads its standard input, which should be in text form and
should contain two positive numbers (\fIx\fR and \fIy\fR) on each
line, separated by spaces or tabs.  The standard output of \fBlog10\fR
contains four columns of numbers, separated by spaces: the common
(base 10) logarithms of \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR, and the \fIx\fR and
\fIy\fR values.  To avoid underflow, if any input is less than
\fBMINDOUBLE\fR (defined in \fI<values.h>\fR as the smallest positive
value that can be represented as a double-precision floating point
quantity), it is replaced by that value.

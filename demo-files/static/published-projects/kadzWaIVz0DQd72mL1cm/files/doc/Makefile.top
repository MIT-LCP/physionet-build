# This file is used with the UNIX `make' command to install on-line
# documentation for the WFDB Software Package, and also to format and print it.
# Before using this file for the first time, check that the site-specific
# variables below are appropriate for your system.

# The primary documentation for the WFDB Software Package consists of 3 guides:
#  * The WFDB Applications Guide.  This guide documents the application
#    programs provided in the app, convert, psd, wave (briefly), and wview
#    subdirectories of wfdb, as well as the file formats supported by the WFDB
#    Software Package. It also includes a tutorial on evaluation of arrhythmia
#    and ischemia detectors using this software and standard databases.
#  * The WFDB Programmer's Guide.  This guide documents the WFDB library.
#    It contains both tutorial and reference material, with many examples, that
#    will be useful if you wish to develop your own application programs for
#    reading, analyzing, or creating digitized, optionally annotated,
#    recordings of signals.
#  * The WAVE User's Guide.  This guide includes a comprehensive tutorial, with
#    reference material, for WAVE, an interactive waveform browser with
#    facilities for annotation editing and control of external analysis
#    programs. WAVE runs on PCs under Linux, and on SPARC-based systems under
#    SunOS or Solaris.
# The files in this directory can be used to prepare printed or on-line
# versions of these guides.

# On-line documentation
# =====================

# The most recent versions of these guides are always available on PhysioNet
# (follow the links from http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).
# Use any web browser to read them.

# If you follow the instructions for a standard installation of the WFDB
# Software Package, the man pages from this directory will be installed so they
# can be read using 'man', 'xman', etc.  The individual pages will be
# accessible to the UNIX `man' command, and to similar commands such as `xman',
# provided that MANDIR (see below) is in your MANPATH (type `man man' for
# further information).

# If you have the necessary formatting software, these man pages and a large
# amount of other documentation can be produced in a wide variety of formats
# from the sources in in this directory (see 'Makefile').  Here is a brief list
# of available formats and the commands needed to produce them:

# WFDB Applications Guide
# printed copy	'make wag-book' (requires troff, tbl, latex, dvips, a printer)
# HTML		'make wag.html' (requires rman, latex2html, and perl)
# man pages	'make wag.man'
# PDF		'make wag.pdf'  (requires troff, tbl, latex, dvips, and ps2pdf)
# PostScript	'make wag.ps'   (requires troff, tbl, latex, dvips, ps2pdf, and
#				 pdftops *)
# WFDB Programmer's Guide
# printed copy	'make wpg-book' (requires troff, texi2dvi, dvips, & a printer)
# Windows help	'make wpg.hlp'  (requires makertf and hcrtf)
# HTML		'make wpg.html' (requires texi2html and perl)
# info		'make wpg.info' (requires makeinfo or GNU emacs)
# PDF		'make wpg.pdf'  (requires texi2dvi)
# PostScript	'make wpg.ps'   (requires texi2dvi and dvips)
#
# WAVE User's Guide
# printed copy	'make wug-book' (requires troff, latex, dvips, and a printer)
# HTML		'make wug.html' (requires latex2html and perl)
# PDF		'make wug.pdf'  (requires pdflatex)
#  PostScript	'make wug.ps'   (requires latex and dvips)

# * See 'wag-src/Makefile' for information about making a PostScript version
#   of the WFDB Applications Guide without the use of ps2pdf or pdftops.

# If GNU emacs or GNU info has been installed on your system, a hypertext
# version of the WFDB Programmer's Guide may be installed by typing `make
# pg.info'.  Once the info files have been installed, provided that INFODIR is
# in your INFOPATH (see below), you can browse the guide from within emacs by
# typing C-h i to enter the info system, and selecting `WFDB library' from the
# top-level menu.  Note that `make info' adds an entry for the Guide to the
# top-level `info' file ($INFODIR/dir).  If you install a GNU emacs update,
# this entry may disappear; to restore it, simply `make pg.info' again.

# The WFDB Programmer's Guide can also be formatted as an MS-Windows help file,
# using 'makertf' and 'hcrtf'.  This requires 'makertf' (open-source, from
# http://makertf.sourceforge.net/) and 'hcrtf' (see the 'makertf' page above
# for further information).  Install both of these programs in your PATH before
# trying to generate pg.hlp.


# Printed documentation
# =====================

# Individual man pages or info nodes can be printed using the facilities of
# man and emacs respectively, or (from the HTML versions) using your web
# browser's print facilities.  Complete printed copies of the guides can be
# obtained in one of these ways:
#  - The PostScript versions can be downloaded from PhysioNet for printing on
#    a PostScript printer.  If you don't have a PostScript printer, you may
#    still be able to use Ghostscript (available freely from 
#    http://www.ghostscript.com/) to print these versions on your printer
#    (most popular laser, inkjet, and dot matrix printers are supported by
#    Ghostscript).
#  - The PDF versions can be downloaded from PhysioNet for printing using
#    Acrobat reader (available freely from http://www.adobe.com/).  These
#    can also be read and printed using GhostScript (see above), but there
#    is no advantage in doing so; use the PostScript versions with GhostScript.
#  - The sources for these guides are provided in this directory;  you should
#    use these if you have made additions to the guides or wish to customize
#    them in any other way.  To format the sources, you will need groff or
#    troff, gtbl or tbl, TeX, LaTeX, texi2dvi, and dvips.  To format and print
#    the WFDB Applications Guide, type `make ag' (but read `tmac.dif'
#    first, unless you are using groff).  To print the WAVE User's Guide, type
#    `make ug'.  To print the WFDB Programmer's Guide, type `make pg'.

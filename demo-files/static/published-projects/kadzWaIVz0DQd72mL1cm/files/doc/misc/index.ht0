Includes <TT>man</TT> pages for the applications included in the WFDB Software
Package, and specifications for file formats supported by the WFDB library.
Detailed installation instructions for the WFDB Software Package are included
in an appendix, and a second appendix discusses how the performance of ECG
analyzers can be formally evaluated using standard reference databases and the
standard evaluation tools included in the WFDB Software Package.

.SH NAME
sumstats \- derive aggregate statistics from bxb, rxr, etc., line-format output
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsumstats\fR \fIfile\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program derives the aggregate statistics described in sections 3.5.2 and
3.5.3 of the American National Standard, \fITesting and reporting performance
results of cardiac rhythm and ST segment measurement algorithms\fR (ANSI/AAMI
EC57:1998, based on the earlier AAMI ECAR:1987), and in sections 4.2.14.4.1
and 4.2.14.4.2 of the American National Standard, \fIAmbulatory
electrocardiographs\fR (ANSI/AAMI EC38:1998).
.PP
To use this program, first generate a line-format report \fIfile\fR using the
\fB-l\fR or \fB-L\fR options of \fBbxb\fR(1), \fBepicmp\fR(1), \fBmxm\fR(1), or
\fBrxr\fR(1).  This file must include column headings so that \fBsumstats\fR
can recognize the file type.  Output is written to the standard output;  it
includes a copy of the input file, with aggregate statistics appended at the
end.

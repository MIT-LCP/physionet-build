.SH NAME
rdedfann \- extract annotations from an EDF+ file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrdedfann -r\fR \fIedffile\fR [ \fIoptions\fR ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program prints the annotations from an EDF+ file in the same format as
\fBrdann\fR does for WFDB-compatible annotation files.

.PP
Options include:
.TP
\fB-F\fI frequency\fR
Set the sampling frequency to \fIfrequency\fR (in Hz).
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print a brief usage summary.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Verbose mode (print column headings).
.TP
\fB-x\fR
Print EDF+ annotation text in 'aux' rather than 'anntyp' column.

.PP
Note that the annotation mnemonics in EDF+ files do not in general
match those used in WFDB-compatible annotation files, so that it will
often be desirable to translate those that come from EDF+ files
before converting the text with \fBwrann\fR.  For example, this
command can be used to extract annotations from \fBfoo.edf\fR, change
the EDF+ annotation type "QRS" to the WFDB type "N", and then produce
a WFDB-compatible annotation file \fBfoo.edf.qrs\fR:
.br
        \fBrdedfann -r foo.edf | sed s/QRS/N/ | wrann -r foo.edf -a qrs\fR

.PP
Recent versions of \fBwrann\fR copy unrecognized mnemonics into
the \fBaux\fR field, setting the annotation type to \fBNOTE\fR, so it
is no longer essential to translate mnemonics as described above before
processing \fBrdedfann\fR's output with \fBwrann\fR.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
It may be necessary to set and export the shell variable \fBWFDB\fR (see
\fBsetwfdb\fR(1)).
.SH AVAILABILITY
This program is provided in the \fIconvert\fR directory of the WFDB Software
Package.  Run \fBmake\fR in that directory to compile and install it if it
has not been installed already.

#### PhysioNet privileged operations ####

# This file defines specific commands that may be invoked by automated
# scripts using 'sudo'.  Each command listed in this file must have a
# single, clearly-defined function.  The program must be carefully
# written to check all of its inputs to avoid privilege escalation.
# Do not add commands to this list without carefully considering the
# consequences.

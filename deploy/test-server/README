This directory contains scripts for configuring a demo PhysioNet
server in a virtual machine.

Quick start:

1. You must have 'qemu-system-x86', 'qemu-utils', '7z', and maybe
   other stuff.  As of this writing, about 1.9 GB of disk space is
   required.

2. Download the latest installer (amd64 netinst) CD image from
   https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/debian-installer/
   (e.g., debian-11.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso) to this directory.

3. Run ./kvm-pntest-create to create the virtual disk image.

4. Run ./kvm-pntest to launch the virtual machine.

5. Once the virtual machine is running, run
     ./ssh-install-pn-test-server HEAD
   to install the current HEAD from your git repository.

When that finishes, you will have a web server running at
<https://localhost:10443/>.

Changes to the virtual disk will not be saved, so you can kill the VM
at any time and re-run steps 4-5 for a clean installation.  You
shouldn't need to run steps 1-3 again.

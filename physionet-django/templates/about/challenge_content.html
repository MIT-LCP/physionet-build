  <h1>Challenges</h1>
  <p>PhysioNet supports open challenges, which invite participants to tackle clinically interesting questions that are
    either highly topical or neglected. Since the launch of PhysioNet in 1999, PhysioNet has co-hosted the annual <a
            href="moody-challenge-overview">George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge</a> in collaboration with <a
            href="http://www.cinc.org/">Computing in Cardiology</a>. We also support external challenges hosted by our
    wider <a href="community-challenge">community</a>.

  <h2>The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges</h2>
  <p>Formerly known as the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge, the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge runs

            href="https://moody-challenge.physionet.org">Current Challenge Site</a>. A list of past Challenges with
    links to outputs (open source code and open access data), can be found <a href="moody-challenge">here</a>.

  <h3>Organizing a Moody Challenge</h3>
  <p>If you are interested in contributing to, or posing a Moody Challenge, please feel free to contact us (at
    moody-challenge@physionet.org) with details of the data and labels that you can provide, the nature of the problem
    that you wish to solve, and some demo code that makes a basic attempt to solve the problem. We strongly recommend
    having at least three independent databases, two to become public, and one to remain private/hidden. Depending on
    the data, we generally need about one year to prepare a Challenge. For more information on the general aims and
    framework of the Challenge, and the criteria for a successful event, please see <a
            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10502">here</a>.

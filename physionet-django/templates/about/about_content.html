  <h1>Tutorials</h1>

  <h5 id="howto">How to...</h5>
  <ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/database/pbi/">Finding records in PhysioBank</a>.
    This tutorial describes the PhysioBank Index of over 36,000 records that
    can be viewed by the PhysioBank ATM, and how to find records with desired
    characteristics using the web-based PhysioBank Record Search or via
    command-line tools.</li>

<li><a href="https://archive.physionet.org/tutorials/physiobank-text.shtml">How to obtain PhysioBank data in text
    form</a>.  Many readers wish to convert binary data from PhysioBank
    (PhysioNet's data archive) into text form for further processing.  There
    are <a href="https://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/physiobank-intro.shtml">many good reasons</a>
    not to do so.  If you are determined to do it anyway, here's how.</li>

<li><a href="https://archive.physionet.org/tutorials/creating-records.shtml">Creating PhysioBank (WFDB-compatible)
    Records and Data Collections</a>.  If you have digital recordings of signals
    or time series, perhaps with annotations, that you would like to study using
    PhysioToolkit software such as that in the WFDB software package, or that
    you would like to contribute to PhysioBank, this tutorial should get you
    started on creating PhysioBank-compatible records from your data.</li>

<li><a href="https://archive.physionet.org/mirrors/mirror-howto.shtml">How to set up a mirror of
    PhysioNet</a>.  A PhysioNet mirror can run on almost any computer made
    in the last ten years, and it can provide local users with fast
    access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software, even in areas
    with slow or unreliable Internet connections.  PhysioNet mirrors are
    easy to set up and essentially self-maintaining.  Put an old computer
    to good use and help PhysioNet users in your area.</li>

<!-- <li><a href="https://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/tutorials/using-mimic2/">Using the MIMIC II
    Database</a>.  The MIMIC-II Database

 -->
<li><a href="https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/cygwin/">An Introduction to Cygwin</a>.
    PhysioToolkit includes a large collection of open-source, POSIX-compliant
    software that can be useful to most PhysioNet visitors.  Since almost all
    of the popular platforms are also POSIX-compliant, it's easy to get
    PhysioToolkit software running on those platforms, including GNU/Linux,
    Mac OS X, and all versions of Unix.  Microsoft Windows is not
    POSIX-compliant, but a free software package called Cygwin provides a
    stable and very complete POSIX layer on top of Windows.  By installing
    Cygwin on your Windows PC, you will be able to run PhysioToolkit software
    on it.  This tutorial explains how to do so, without interfering with
    any Windows software you may be using.</li>

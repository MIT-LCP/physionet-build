  <h2>Submission process</h2>
  <p>Submitting data and software to PhysioNet is similar to submitting an article to a journal. Briefly, the process for submitting your work for publication in PhysioNet is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are the submitting author, create a new project using the project management system.</li>
    <li>Add your project details. These will include contact information for co-authors, descriptive text, and data files.</li>
    <li>Once you are satisfied, submit the project to the editorial team for review.</li>
    <li>You will be notified of an editorial decision when the review process is complete.</li>
    <li>Once any issues have been addressed, your data or software will be published on PhysioNet.</li>
    <li>When a project is published, its content is fixed and cannot be changed.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="criteria">
  <h2>Criteria for publication</h2>
  <p>Our goals are to ensure that the data is safe to share and that it is sufficiently well structured and described for it to be a valuable resource for the research community. Some of the high-level criteria that we will be considering when reviewing your project include:</p>
  <h5>Data Quality</h5>

<section id="editorial">
  <h2>Editorial process</h2>
  <p>Once your project is submitted to PhysioNet, it will be reviewed by one or more content specialists. Based on this review, you will be provided with an initial editorial decision within four weeks from submission. The possible decisions are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Accept</strong>: The editor is mostly satisfied with the content. The submission
        continues into the copyedit stage.</li>
    <li><strong>Resubmit</strong>: The content is suitable for publication, but changes are
        required to make it more clear or reusable. Changes may include adding 
        required information, restructuring files, and rewording content. 
        Once the submitting author has made these changes,
        they may resubmit the project for review.</li>
    <li><strong>Reject</strong>: The content is not suitable for publication.</li>
  </ol>

<h1>About PhysioNet</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/about.shtml">About the
    PhysioBank Archives</a>.  PhysioBank contains well over 36,000 recordings
    of annotated, digitized physiologic signals and time series;  this
    brief tutorial begins with an exploration of these archives using
    your web browser, followed by pointers on downloading data, information
    about the archives themselves, and recommendations of software available
    freely from this site for further study of PhysioBank data.</li>

<li><a href="http://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/getting-started.shtml">An Introduction to
    PhysioToolkit</a>.  PhysioNet's collection of software for
    viewing, analyzing, and modelling physiologic signals and time
    series consists of open-source software that can be studied,
    verified, and modified to suit the specific needs of your work.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="howto">How to ...</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/database/pbi/">Finding records in PhysioBank</a>.
    This tutorial describes the PhysioBank Index of over 36,000 records that
    can be viewed by the PhysioBank ATM, and how to find records with desired
    characteristics using the web-based PhysioBank Record Search or via
    command-line tools.</li>

<li><a href="http://archive.physionet.org/physiobank-text.shtml">How to obtain PhysioBank data in text
    form</a>.  Many readers wish to convert binary data from PhysioBank
    (PhysioNet's data archive) into text form for further processing.  There
    are <a href="http://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/physiobank-intro.shtml">many good reasons</a>
    not to do so.  If you are determined to do it anyway, here's how.</li>

<li><a href="http://archive.physionet.org/tutorials/creating-records.shtml">Creating PhysioBank (WFDB-compatible)
    Records and Data Collections</a>.  If you have digital recordings of signals
    or time series, perhaps with annotations, that you would like to study using
    PhysioToolkit software such as that in the WFDB software package, or that
    you would like to contribute to PhysioBank, this tutorial should get you
    started on creating PhysioBank-compatible records from your data.</li>

<li><a href="http://archive.physionet.org/mirrors/mirror-howto.shtml">How to set up a mirror of
    PhysioNet</a>.  A PhysioNet mirror can run on almost any computer made
    in the last ten years, and it can provide local users with fast
    access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software, even in areas
    with slow or unreliable Internet connections.  PhysioNet mirrors are
    easy to set up and essentially self-maintaining.  Put an old computer
    to good use and help PhysioNet users in your area.</li>

<li><a href="http://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/tutorials/using-mimic2/">Using the MIMIC II
    Database</a>.  The <a href=/pn5/mimic2db/>MIMIC II Database</a>
    has many types of data that are not available in other PhysioBank
    data collections.  This tutorial is intended to help you get
    started on a project that makes use of this rich data collection.</li>

<li><a href="http://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/cygwin/">An Introduction to Cygwin</a>.
    PhysioToolkit includes a large collection of open-source, POSIX-compliant
    software that can be useful to most PhysioNet visitors.  Since almost all
    of the popular platforms are also POSIX-compliant, it's easy to get
    PhysioToolkit software running on those platforms, including GNU/Linux,
    Mac OS X, and all versions of Unix.  Microsoft Windows is not
    POSIX-compliant, but a free software package called Cygwin provides a
    stable and very complete POSIX layer on top of Windows.  By installing
    Cygwin on your Windows PC, you will be able to run PhysioToolkit software
    on it.  This tutorial explains how to do so, without interfering with
    any Windows software you may be using.</li>

<li><a href="http://archive.physionet.org/tutorials/apt/">Applying PhysioNet tools to manage neurophysiological
    signals</a>.  How to import and handle data from commercial devices using
    PhysioToolkit and other open source software.  This tutorial was
    contributed by Jesus Olivan Palacios, a neurophysiologist who has written
    an excellent introduction to much of the software available from PhysioNet
    in the form of a series of hands-on exercises using data provided with the
    tutorial.  Very readable, and highly recommended for neurophysiologists and
    others alike.  (Also see Sciteam, below, by the same author).</li>

    tutorial describes how to use the HRV toolkit (available here) to
    select and prepare time series of inter-beat intervals and to calculate
    measurements of the basic time- and frequency-domain HRV
    statistics that are widely used in the literature.  Particular
    attention is given to techniques for identifying and dealing with
    outliers, in order to permit reliable determination of
    measurements.</li>

<li><a href="http://archive.physionet.org/tutorials/pr-comp/">Morphology Representation Using Principal
    Components</a>.  Using the QRS complex of the ECG as an example,
    this tutorial presents practical methods for principal
    component analysis of waveforms, including software that can be used as
    is or customized as desired.</li>

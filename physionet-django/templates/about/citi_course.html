  <p>To access certain resources on {{ SITE_NAME }}, you must complete training in human research and data privacy. We recommend the CITI Program's "Data or Specimens Only Research" course. A link to the website can be found here: <a href="https://about.citiprogram.org/">CITI Program.</a> You must create an account with CITI Program before proceeding. Follow the instructions below to complete the course:</p>

    <li>Search for "Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates". Click the checkmarks to agree. You are affiliating with MIT for the purpose of accessing data hosted on MIT servers. The MIT Affiliation is designated for non-MIT personnel to be able to register on CITI to take the 'Data or Specimens Only Research' course. It is advisable not to register as an independent learner to avoid paying additional fees.</li>

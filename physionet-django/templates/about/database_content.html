A decrease in baroreflex sensitivity with aging is hypothesized to represent a contributing causal factor in the etiology of primary hypertension. To assess baroreflex function in human subjects, two complementary methods to simulate the response in heart rate elicited by the Valsalva maneuver were developed and applied to data obtained from a cohort of healthy normal volunteers.</li>

    a variety of sleep-related disorders.  The CAP Sleep Database is a
    collection of 108 polysomnographic recordings from the Sleep
    Disorders Center of the Ospedale Maggiore of Parma, Italy.  Each
    record includes 3 or more EEG signals together with EOG, chin and
    tibial EMG, airflow, respiratory effort, SaO2, and ECG signals,
    and reference sleep stage and CAP annotations, This database is
    intended to provide a useful number of carefully annotated
    examples of CAP in a representative variety of pathophysiologic
    contexts, for development and evaluation of automated CAP
    analyzers, as well as to support basic studies of the dynamics of
    CAP.</li>

    Sweeney and colleagues at the National University of Ireland in Maynooth,
    contains examples of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and
    electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings that have been created for evaluating
    artifact removal methods.  In each such recording, one or two pairs of
    similar physiological signals have been acquired from transducers in close
    proximity.  One signal of each pair is contaminated by motion artifact,
    documented in each case by simultaneously recorded outputs of 3-axis
    accelerometers affixed to each transducer.</li>

<li>[Class 3] <a href="ob1db/">OB-1 Database</a>.  This project is developing a
    set of recordings of fetal scalp electrograms and uterine muscular
    activity, with beat-by-beat annotations of the fetal ECG, to support
    studies of fetal heart rate variability.  One sample recording is currently
    available; more than additional 100 data sets have been collected and are in
    preparation in the OB-1 project on PhysioNetWorks. Each data set documents
    the in-hospital course of labor and delivery (typically several hours in
    length), and consists of a record containing a continuous fetal ECG signal
    and a simultaneously recorded UC (uterine muscular activity) signal,
    accompanied by maternal clinical data and newborn clinical data.</li>

<li>[Class 3] <a href="sleep-edfx/">Sleep-EDF Database [Expanded]</a>.  This

    The first was a study of age effects on sleep in healthy subjects
    (20 subjects, aged 25-34, with two 20-hour PSGs from consecutive nights
    for 19 subjects);  the second was a study of temazepam effects on sleep
    in 22 subjects who had mild difficulty falling asleep but were otherwise
    healthy (9-hour PSGs of each subject on placebo).  A small
    <a href="sleep-edf/">subset</a> of this dataset was previously contributed

    and to support ongoing studies.</li>

<li>[Class 3] <a href="shhpsgdb/">Sleep Heart Health Study
    Polysomnography Database</a>.  A single overnight polysomnogram

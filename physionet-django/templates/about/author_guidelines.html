  <h2 id="overview">Publication Process Overview</h2>
  <p>These are the steps for publishing a resource on PhysioNet:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a project.</li>
    <li>Prepare the project for submission:</li>
    {% include "about/preparation_checklist.html" %}
    <li>Submit the project for review.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>An editor is assigned and makes a decision:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Reject - The content is not suitable for publication. Submission
          ends.</li>
        <li>Resubmit with revisions - The editor requests changes. The submitting author
          makes these changes and resubmits.</li>
        <li>Accept - The submission continues into the copyedit stage.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The editor copyedits the metadata and files for any final changes.
        When all authors approve, this editor can complete this step.</li>
      <li>The editor publishes the project.</li>
    </ol>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="creation">Project Creation</h2>
  <p>An account is required for creating projects. The
     <a href="{% url 'create_project' %}" target="_blank">project
     creation page</a> can be found in the navbar under the
     <em>publish</em> panel, or your
     <a href="{% url 'project_home' %}" target="_blank">project
     home</a> page, which lists all of your authoring projects.
     Projects are not accessible by anyone except for their authors.
  </p>

  <p>When creating a project, choose the correct resource type, as
     this <strong>cannot be changed</strong> later. If you would like
     to contribute both data and code from a single related project,
     submit them in separate projects, and refer them to each other.</p>

  <h2 id="submission">Submission and Editing</h2>
  <p>If the project passes all of its automatic checks, the submitting
     author may submit the project for review, where an editor will be
     assigned. While under review, the project
     cannot be edited.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Editor Decision</h3>
  <p>The editor will decide whether the project is suitable for publication. The possible decisions are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Reject - The content is not suitable for publication. Submission ends.</li>
    <li>Resubmit - The content is suitable for publication, but changes are
        required from the submitting author to make it more clear or reusable.
        Changes may include adding required information, restructuring the files,
        and rewording content. Once the submitting author has made these changes,
        they may resubmit the project for review.</li>
    <li>Accept - The editor is mostly satisfied with the content. The submission
        continues into the copyedit stage.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>All of the <a href="#quality-guidelines">quality assurance guidelines</a> must be met by your submission if it is to be accepted.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Copyedit</h3>
  <p>The editor makes small changes to the files and metadata that they deem
     suitable for facilitating reuse of the project. Such changes may include
     slight rewording of descriptions, renaming of files, and generating a
     compressed archive of the whole set of files for easy download. When they
     have finished making changes, they will email the authors. When all authors
     approve of the changes, the editor may complete this stage.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Publish</h3>
  <p>The editor publishes the project.</p>

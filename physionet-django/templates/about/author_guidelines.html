  <h2 id="overview">Publication Overview</h2>
  <p>These are the steps for publishing a resource on PhysioNet:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a project with a specified resource type.</li>
    <li>Invite co-authors to be credited on the publication.
        Each co-authors must accept their invitation, and fill in
        their name and affiliations.</li>
    <li>Fill in project metadata, including license and access
        policy.</li>
    <li>Upload the files.</li>
    <li>Check the project preview, and ensure that the automatic
        checks pass.</li>
    <li>Submit the project for review/publication. All co-authors
        must approve the submission.</li>
    <li>If the editor accepts the submission, a *version of the
        project is published. If it is rejected, you may address
        the issues and resubmit.</li>
    <li>Optional: publish subsequent versions of the project.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>See the following sections for details.</p>

  <p>* It is important to separate the concepts of a project, and
     published versions of a project. A user may create a project and
     edit its fields. If it is submitted and accepted for publication,
     a version of the project is published, which falls into the
     public domain and cannot be edited. The original project remains,
     and can be edited and resubmitted to publish subsequent versions
     if desired.</p>

  <h2 id="project-creation">Project Creation</h2>
  <p>An account is required for creating projects. The
     <a href="{% url 'create_project' %}" target="_blank">project
     creation page</a> can be found in the navbar under the
     <em>publish</em> panel, or your
     <a href="{% url 'project_home' %}" target="_blank">project
     home</a> page, which lists all of your authoring projects.</p>
  </p>

  <p>Projects are not accessible by, or even visible to anyone, except
     initially for the submitting author, and subsequently also for
     invited co-authors.</p>

  <p>When creating a project, choose the correct resource type, as
     this <strong>cannot be changed</strong> later. If you would like
     to contribute both data and code from a single related project,
     submit them in separate projects, and refer them to each other.</p>
  <br>
  <hr>

  <h2 id="authors">Authors</h2>
  <p>Each project can have one <strong>submitting author</strong>, and
     many co-authors. The user who creates the project is the initial
     submitting author, though they can assign this role to another
     co-author if they want. Only the submitting author can invite,
     remove, and *order co-authors, fill in the project metadata,
     upload/edit files, and submit the project for review/publication.
     * The author order is the order in which author names will be
     displayed in the published project. The submitting author is
     responsible for preparing the project for submission, but does
     not need to be listed first.</p>

  <p>The submitting author can invite a co-author to the project by
     specifying an email address. An email will be sent to the target
     email address. If a PhysioNet account is already associated with
     the specified email, the invitation will appear in the user's
     <a href="{% url 'project_home' %}" target="_blank">project
     home</a> page. If not, once they associate the email to
     their existing account, or create a new account with the email,
     they will be able to view and accept the invitation in the
     aforementioned location.</p>

  <p>All authors must fill in their own affiliation information on a
     project by project basis, which is not tied to the affiliations
     listed in their PhysioNet profiles. Their names however, are
     tied to the names specified in the profiles. Non-submitting
     authors can view the project content as it is being prepared, but
     are unable to make any edits to the files and descriptive
     metadata. All non-submitting authors are required to approve
     project submissions initiated by the submitting author.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2 id="access">Access Policies</h2>
  <p>Each published project has an access policy chosen by the
     submitting author. The descriptive metadata of all published
     projects are publically visible. The following access policies
     control access to the files:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Open</strong>: Anyone can access the files, as long
        as they conform to the terms of the specified
        <a href="{% url 'licenses' %}" target="_blank">license</a>.
        No data use agreement (DUA) is provided.</li>
    <li><strong>Restricted</strong>: Only logged in users who sign
        the specified
        <a href="{% url 'duas' %}" target="_blank">DUA</a> can
        access the files.</li>
    <li><strong>Credentialed</strong>: Only PhysioNet credentialed
        users who sign the specified DUA can access the files. This
        tier is only for sensitive  databases. Please
        <a href="{% url 'contact' %}" target="_blank">
        contact us</a> beforehand if you would like to contribute
        such a resource.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>We strongly encourage using the 'open' access policy, and will
     reject non-open submissions that are not justified.</p>
  <br>
  <hr>


  <h2 id="files">Uploading Files</h2>
  <p>PhysioNet resources should be reusable by the greater scientific
      community. Data should be provided in an open format, such as
      text, csv, or wfdb. Large time-series data, especially
      physiological waveforms, should be provided in wfdb format. Code
      should be submitted in source format.</p>

  <p>Recall that only the submitting author can upload/edit files. All
     projects start with a moderately low size quota. The submitting
     author may request more storage if needed.</p>
  <br>
  <hr>

  <h2 id="review">Review Process</h2>
  <p>If the project passes all of its automatic checks, the submitting
     author may submit the project for review/publication. Once all
     the co-authors approve the review submission, a set of reviewers
     is assigned to the project. While under review, the project
     cannot be edited.</p>

  <p>Once all the reviewers have completed their review, the editor
     will make the decision to accept or reject the publication. If
     the, submission is accepted, a version of the project is published.
     If it is rejected, you may address the issues and resubmit.</li></p>

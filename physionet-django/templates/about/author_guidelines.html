  <h2>Creating the project metadata</h2>
  <p>To help the community to reuse your shared resources, we 
    require a detailed description. The information that you provide 
    should focus on the resource and how it might be reused. During the submission process
  you are asked to provide information such as a title, an abstract
  for distribution to search indexes, and context describing the manner in which
  the resource was created. Further details are outlined below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Title</strong>: Your title should be no longer than 200 characters. Do not include acronyms and abbreviations, and where possible avoid leading with "The". Only letters, numbers, spaces, underscores, and hyphens are allowed.</li>
    <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Your abstract must be no longer than 250 words. It should provide the reader with a high level overview of your resource. References should not be included. </li>
    <li><strong>Background</strong>: Your background should provide the reader with an introduction to the resource. The section should offer context in which the resource was created, outline your motivations for sharing, and highlight potential areas for reuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Methods & Technical Implementation</strong>: The "Methods" and "Technical Implementation" sections provide details of the procedures used to create your resource. For software, the section may cover aspects such as development process, software design, and description of algorithms. For data, the section may include details such as experimental design, data acquisition, and data processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Content description</strong>: Your content description should describe the resource in detail, outlining how files are structured, file formats, and a description of what the files contain.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage notes</strong>: This section should provide the reader with information relevant to reuse. This might include technical instructions or ideas for projects that could make use of the resource.</li>
    <li><strong>Acknowledgments</strong>: In this section, acknowledge the people who helped with the research, but who were not included as co-authors. In addition, provide funding information.</li>
    <li><strong>Conflicts of interest</strong>: A statement on potential conflicts of interest is required. If the authors have no conflicts of interest, the section should say "The author(s) have no conflicts of interest to declare".</li>
    <li><strong>Version</strong>: The version number of the resource. <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic versioning</a> is encouraged (major version, minor version, patch version). If unsure, put "1.0.0".</li>
    <li><strong>References</strong>: Please use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_system">Vancouver reference style</a>. All citations should be numbered sequentially in the text in square brackets. For example, the first citation [1], the second citation [2], and the third and fourth citations [3,4]. Entries in the reference list should be in the following style: <em>1. Xu YZ, Geng DC, Mao HQ, Zhu XS, Yang HL (2010). "A comparison of the proximal femoral nail antirotation device and dynamic hip screw in the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fracture". J Int Med Res. 38: 1266â€“1275. PMID 20925999.</em></li>

  <h2>Preparing your project files</h2>
  <p>When submitting a project, you will be asked to upload relevant data and
  software files. Please review the following guidelines when preparing your
  files for submission:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>All projects</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>A README file should be included alongside the files. At minimum, the readme should include 
        a title and a brief description of the package content.</li>
        <li>Sensitive data and protected health information must have been removed prior to submission.</li>
        <li>Files should be clearly named and must not include spaces or special characters (e.g. "/","\,".").</li>
        <li>Files should be provided in non-proprietary formats (for example, CSV), except where there is a clear reason not to do so.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data (general)</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>In most cases, tabulated datasets should be structured following the principles of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data">tidy data</a>". For example, each variable should be in a column and each observation (or case) in a row.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Software</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Instructions for installation and usage should be clearly documented.</li>
        <li>Dependencies should be clearly indicated, for example in a requirements file.</li>
        <li>A testing framework should be used to demonstrate correct functioning of major features of the software.</li>
        <li>Standard style guidelines should be followed where appropriate (for example, PEP8 for Python).</li>
        <li>The software should be logically structured and packaged according to standard practice.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

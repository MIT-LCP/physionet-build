  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>PhysioNet is a unique resource for research and education, offering free access to large collections of physiological data and related open-source software. In cooperation with the annual <a href="http://www.cinc.org/" target="_blank">Computing in Cardiology</a> conference, PhysioNet also hosts an annual series of challenges, focusing research on unsolved problems in clinical and basic science. PhysioNet is managed by members of the <a href="https://lcp.mit.edu/">MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology</a>. For a brief history, see our <a href="{% url 'timeline' %}">timeline</a>. </p>

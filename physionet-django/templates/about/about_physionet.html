  <h1>PhysioNet: Brief Introduction</h1>
  <br>
  <p>PhysioNet, the moniker of the <em>Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals</em>, was established in 1999 under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as described further below. The PhysioNet Resource’s original and ongoing missions were to conduct and catalyze for biomedical research and education, in part by offering free access to large collections of physiological and clinical data and related open-source software. In cooperation with the annual <a href="http://www.cinc.org/">Computing in Cardiology</a> conference, PhysioNet also hosts an annual series of challenges, focusing research on unsolved problems in clinical and basic science. Members of PhysioNet’s team are actively involved in innovative work on analysis of physiologic signals, both from basic and translational perspectives.</p>
  <p>The PhysioNet platform is managed by members of the <a href="https://lcp.mit.edu/">MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology</a>. The other core laboratory of the PhysioNet Resource is the <a href="http://reylab.bidmc.harvard.edu/">Margret and H.A. Rey Institute for Nonlinear Dynamics</a> at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.</p>

<h1>A Community Resource</h1>

<p>
The PhysioNet resource, established in 1999, is intended to stimulate
current research and new investigations in the study of complex biomedical
and physiologic signals.  It has three closely interdependent components:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An  <a href="{% url 'database_overview' %}">extensive archive</a> of well-characterized digital recordings of
physiologic signals, time series, and related data for use by the biomedical
  research community. PhysioNet includes collections of
cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals
from healthy subjects and patients with a variety of conditions with
major public health implications, including sudden cardiac death,
congestive heart failure, epilepsy, gait disorders, sleep apnea, and
aging.  These collections include data from a wide range of studies,
  as developed and contributed by members of the research community.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A large and growing  <a href="{% url 'software_overview' %}">library of software</a> for physiologic signal processing and analysis,
detection of physiologically significant events using both classical techniques
and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics,
interactive display and characterization of signals, creation of new databases,
simulation of physiologic and other signals, quantitative evaluation and
comparison of analysis methods, and analysis of nonequilibrium and
  nonstationary processes.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A  <a href="{% url 'tutorial_overview' %}">collection of popular tutorials and educational materials</a>,  offering expert guidance in approaches for exploring and analysing health data
  and physiologic signals. A unifying theme for these resources
  is a focus on the extraction of “hidden” information from biomedical data,
  providing information that may have diagnostic or prognostic value in medicine,
  or explanatory or predictive power in basic research.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
PhysioNet is not only the name of
the Resource, but also of its web site, <a href="https://physionet.org/">physionet.org</a>. The website was established by the Resource as its mechanism for free and open
dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source
software for analyzing them, by providing facilities for cooperative analysis
of data and evaluation of proposed new algorithms.  In addition to providing
free electronic access to data and software, the PhysioNet web site offers service and training via on-line
tutorials to assist users at entry and more advanced levels.  In cooperation
with the annual <a href=http://www.cinc.org/ target="other">Computing in
Cardiology</a> conference, PhysioNet hosts an annual series
of <a href="{% url 'challenge_overview' %}">challenges</a>, in which researchers and students
address unsolved problems of clinical or basic scientific interest using data
and software provided by PhysioNet.</p>

<p>
All data and software included in PhysioNet are carefully reviewed.  We invite you to participate in the ongoing review process.  By sharing common data sets, and software in source form, the research community benefits from access to materials that have been rigorously
scrutinized by many investigators.  We further invite researchers to contribute
data and software for review and possible inclusion in our resource collection.  Please review our
<a href="{% url 'about_publish' %}">guidelines for contributors</a> before submitting
material.</p>

<section id="history">
  <h1>Brief History</h1>
  <br>
<p>
Beginning in the mid-1970s, members of the PhysioNet team who were then
working on some of the first microcomputer-based instruments for cardiac
arrhythmia monitoring foresaw the usefulness of establishing shared
databases of well-characterized ECG recordings, as a basis for evaluation,
iterative improvement, and objective comparison of algorithms for automated
arrhythmia analysis.  A five-year effort culminated in the publication of
the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database in 1980, which soon became the standard
reference collection of its type, used by over 500 academic, hospital, and
industry researchers and developers worldwide during the 1980s and 1990s.
Other databases of ECGs and eventually other physiologic signals followed.
By 1999, the MIT group distributed CD-ROMs containing 11 such collections,
and had participated in the development of several others.</p>

<p>
PhysioNet was established in 1999 as the outreach component of
the <em>Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals</em>, a
cooperative project initiated by a diverse group of computer
scientists, physicists, mathematicians, biomedical researchers,
clinicians, and educators at
Boston's <a href="http://reylab.bidmc.harvard.edu/"
target="_blank">Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center</a>/<a href="http://www.med.harvard.edu">Harvard
Medical School</a>, <a href="http://polymer.bu.edu/">Boston
University</a>, and <a href="http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/glasslab/"
title="Prof. Leon Glass, of the Center for Nonlinear Dynamics at McGill University">McGill University</a>, all working together with the
<a href="http://lcp.mit.edu/">MIT</a> group. Many of us
have worked together for 20 years or even longer on problems relating
to characterizing and understanding the dynamics of human physiology,
the implications of dynamical change in diagnosis and treatment of
pathophysiology, novel and robust techniques for physiologic
monitoring in ambulatory subjects and critical care patients, and
applications of model-based reasoning to medical decision support in
intensive care.  The MIT group contributed its 11 databases, and the
software it had developed for exploring and analyzing them, to
establish PhysioBank and PhysioToolkit.  Free availability of these
resources via the Internet catalyzed an even greater explosion of
interest in them, as researchers and students worldwide who had no
previous access to such data or software began new programs of
research, and specialists began comparing their methods. These initial
contributions were quickly supplemented by additional collections of
data and software from their collaborators, and soon after, from many
researchers worldwide.  PhysioBank and PhysioToolkit have grown to
many times their original sizes, and most of the growth has been
thanks to the hard work and generosity of an international community of researchers.</p>

<p>
At the time PhysioNet was established, members of the PhysioNet team
at MIT were preparing to host Computers in Cardiology 2000.  We hoped
to introduce PhysioNet to our international colleagues who would be
attending CinC, by encouraging participation in an activity that made
effective use of the facilities provided by PhysioNet to stimulate
rapid progress on an unsolved problem of practical clinical
significance.  A timely contribution of data made it possible to
create the first <a href="/challenge/">PhysioNet/CinC Challenge</a>,
which attracted the attention of more than a dozen teams to the
subject of detecting sleep apnea from the ECG.  Their efforts were
broadly successful, they discussed their findings at CinC 2000, and an
annual tradition was born. For a summary, see our <a href="{% url 'timeline' %}">timeline</a>. </p>

  <h1>PhysioNet</h1>
  <br>
  <p>PhysioNet is a unique resource for research and education, offering free access to large collections of physiological data and related open-source software. In cooperation with the annual <a href="http://www.cinc.org/" target="_blank">Computing in Cardiology</a> conference, PhysioNet also hosts an annual series of challenges, focusing research on unsolved problems in clinical and basic science. PhysioNet is managed by members of the <a href="https://lcp.mit.edu/">MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology</a>.

  <h1>Brief History</h1>
  <br>
<p>
Beginning in the mid-1970s, members of the PhysioNet team who were then
working on some of the first microcomputer-based instruments for cardiac
arrhythmia monitoring foresaw the usefulness of establishing shared
databases of well-characterized ECG recordings, as a basis for evaluation,
iterative improvement, and objective comparison of algorithms for automated
arrhythmia analysis.  A five-year effort culminated in the publication of
the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database in 1980, which soon became the standard
reference collection of its type, used by over 500 academic, hospital, and
industry researchers and developers worldwide during the 1980s and 1990s.
Other databases of ECGs and eventually other physiologic signals followed.
By 1999, the MIT group distributed CD-ROMs containing 11 such collections,
and had participated in the development of several others.</p>

<p>
PhysioNet was established in 1999 as the outreach component of
the <em>Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals</em>, a
cooperative project initiated by a diverse group of computer
scientists, physicists, mathematicians, biomedical researchers,
clinicians, and educators at
Boston's <a href="http://reylab.bidmc.harvard.edu/"
target="_blank">Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center</a>/<a href="http://www.med.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard
Medical School</a>, <a href="http://polymer.bu.edu/"
target="_blank">Boston
University</a>, and <a href="http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/glasslab/"
target="_blank" title="Prof. Leon Glass, of the Center for Nonlinear Dynamics at McGill University">McGill University</a>, all working together with the
<a href="http://lcp.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a> group. Many of us
have worked together for 20 years or even longer on problems relating
to characterizing and understanding the dynamics of human physiology,
the implications of dynamical change in diagnosis and treatment of
pathophysiology, novel and robust techniques for physiologic
monitoring in ambulatory subjects and critical care patients, and
applications of model-based reasoning to medical decision support in
intensive care.  The MIT group contributed its 11 databases, and the
software it had developed for exploring and analyzing them, to
establish PhysioBank and PhysioToolkit.  Free availability of these
resources via the Internet catalyzed an even greater explosion of
interest in them, as researchers and students worldwide who had no
previous access to such data or software began new programs of
research, and specialists began comparing their methods. These initial
contributions were quickly supplemented by additional collections of
data and software from their collaborators, and soon after, from many
researchers worldwide.  PhysioBank and PhysioToolkit have grown to
many times their original sizes, and most of the growth has been
thanks to the hard work and generosity of an international community of researchers.</p>

<p>
At the time PhysioNet was established, members of the PhysioNet team
at MIT were preparing to host Computers in Cardiology 2000.  We hoped
to introduce PhysioNet to our international colleagues who would be
attending CinC, by encouraging participation in an activity that made
effective use of the facilities provided by PhysioNet to stimulate
rapid progress on an unsolved problem of practical clinical
significance.  A timely contribution of data made it possible to
create the first <a href="/challenge/">PhysioNet/CinC Challenge</a>,
which attracted the attention of more than a dozen teams to the
subject of detecting sleep apnea from the ECG.  Their efforts were
broadly successful, they discussed their findings at CinC 2000, and an
annual tradition was born. For a summary, see our <a href="{% url 'timeline' %}">timeline</a>. </p>

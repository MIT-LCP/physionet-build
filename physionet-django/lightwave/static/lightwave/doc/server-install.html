<h2>Installing a local copy of the LightWAVE server</h2>

<p>
The LightWAVE server, <tt>lightwave</tt>, runs as a CGI application within a web
(http) server.  The web server collects user requests (typically made using the
LightWAVE client running in a web browser on another computer) and forwards them
to the LightWAVE server.  The LightWAVE server parses the requests, obtains the
requested data from local storage or from a data repository such as PhysioNet,
constructs appropriate responses, and passes them back to the web server.
The web server then relays the responses (typically after compression) to the
users.

<p style="color: red"> It is not necessary to install LightWAVE in
order to use it!  Point your browser to <a
href="http://physionet.org/lightwave/">http://physionet.org/lightwave/</a>
to do so.

<p> In normal use, the client, the server, and the data repository are
all hosted on the same machine, and the user visits the URL of the
client in order to use LightWAVE.  For example, PhysioNet hosts a
public server
(<a href="http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/lightwave">http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/lightwave</a>),
a public client
(<a href="http://physionet.org/lightwave/">http://physionet.org/lightwave/</a>),
and a public data repository
(<a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/">http://physionet.org/physiobank/database</a>).

<p>
It is also possible for the client, the server, and the data
repository to be hosted on different machines.  For example, a locally
hosted LightWAVE client can make use of the public server and data
repository on PhysioNet, or a locally hosted client and server can use
a remote data repository (or even multiple data repositories hosted on
multiple remote machines).

<p>
This technical note describes how to install the LightWAVE server so
that it can be hosted on your own computer while interacting with the
public data repository on PhysioNet.  The final section describes how
to set up your own data repository, using PhysioNet and its
<a href="http://physionet.org/mirrors/">mirrors</a> as a model.

<h3>Who would want a locally hosted LightWAVE server?</h3>

<p>
A locally hosted server and a local data repository are needed if you wish to
use LightWAVE on a machine that has no Internet connection.  (For example, some
of the early development of LightWAVE was done on a notebook PC while flying
across the Pacific!)

<p>
If you use a PhysioNet <a href="http://physionet.org/mirrors/">mirror</a>
that doesn't host its own LightWAVE server, a locally hosted server
can be configured to use the mirror as its primary data repository,
with the PhysioNet master server used only as a source of data that
are not available on the mirror.

<p>
You might also find a locally hosted server convenient for working on
your own data.  (There are alternatives for this, including uploading
your data to secure storage on
<a href="https://physionet.org/users/">PhysioNetWorks</a>;  this also
makes it easy to share your data with colleagues anywhere.)

<p>
Finally, if you are interested in extending the capabilities of the
server itself, you will need a local copy of it.  Note that LightWAVE is
free software licensed under the <a href="COPYING.html">GPL</a>, which
means that you are free to copy, use, and modify it, but you may not
distribute modified compiled versions of it unless you also make the
source code for your modified versions available.

<h3>Requirements for a LightWAVE server</h3>

<p>
The LightWAVE server runs as a CGI application controlled by a web
server.  To date, the LightWAVE server has been compiled and installed
successfully on several versions of Fedora and Ubuntu GNU/Linux,
including both 32- and 64-bit versions, using the Apache web server.

<p>
The LightWAVE server code is contained in a single C source file with
no explicit platform dependencies.  All of the external libraries it
uses are also platform-independent.  You should be able to compile it
successfully with any ANSI/ISO C compiler on any platform.  (If you
attempt to compile and run the LightWAVE server on Mac OS X or on
Windows, please let me know if you were successful, and if so, please
send me a brief description of what steps were needed.)

<p>
To receive edits made using LightWAVE clients hosted on the same web
server, a second CGI application (lw-scribe, written in Perl) is needed.
This application uses a command-line application (patchann, written in
C) to merge edit logs with original annotation files and write new
annotation files.  lw-scribe and patchann are not needed unless you
need to handle annotation edits.

<h3>Download the LightWAVE sources</h3>

<p>
The LightWAVE sources are available within the LightWAVE project on
PhysioNetWorks.  To obtain them:

<ol>
<li>If you have not already done so, go to
<a href="https://physionet.org/users/">https://physionet.org/users/</a> and
create a personal PhysioNetWorks account.  It's free and the process takes
only a minute or two.

<li>Log in to your PhysioNetWorks account and look for the link to
LightWAVE in the <b>Projects</b> section on your home page.  Follow the
link and look for the signup message ("Interested PhysioNetWorks members
may obtain access to this project now by clicking here.").  Click on
the word "here" in the message to join the project.

<li>From the project's archives (<a
href="https://physionet.org/works/LightWAVE/files">
https://physionet.org/works/LightWAVE/files</a>), find and download the most
recent set of sources.  Each version is available as a tarball (e.g.,
<tt>lightwave-0.43.tar.gz</tt>) that can be downloaded as a single file and
unpacked, or you can download individual files from the most recent version
from the <tt>lightwave</tt> subdirectory.  For downloading hints, see <a
href="http://physionet.org/faq.shtml#downloading-binaries">How can I download
binary files?</a>; for instructions on unpacking tarballs, see <a
href="http://physionet.org/faq.shtml#tar-gz">How can I unpack a .tar.gz archive
(a "tarball")?</a>.  If you choose to download individual files, note that you
will need to create a complete copy of the <tt>lightwave</tt>
directory tree in order to test your installation with the LightWAVE client.
</ol>

<h3>Edit the <tt>Makefile</tt></h3>

<p>
In the <tt>lightwave</tt> directory, open <tt>Makefile</tt> in a text editor
(not a word processor) and read it.  The comments near the top of the
file describe other free software components you may need to install
before compiling and installing the LightWAVE server.

<p>
Currently, these components include:

<ul>
<li> a properly configured web server, such as
     <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>
<li> <a href="http://libcgi.sourceforge.net/">libcgi</a>
<li> <a href="http://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml">libwfdb</a>
<li> <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libcurl</a>
<li> an ANSI/ISO C compiler, such as <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>
     and a few other standard POSIX tools including 'make', 'cp',
     'mkdir', 'mv', 'rm', 'sed', and 'tar' (all standard on Linux and Mac OS X,
     components of <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> on Windows)
<li> <a href="https://www.perl.org/">perl</a>
     and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI/">CGI.pm</a> (for lw-scribe
     only)
</ul>

<p>
(This list may be incomplete; consult the <tt>Makefile</tt> for any
additions.)

<p> As the comments near the top of the file note, you may need to change the
values of some parameters that are defined in <tt>Makefile</tt> to
match your installation.

<h3>Build and install the LightWAVE server</h3>

<p>
Once you have checked the <tt>Makefile</tt> and made any necessary
changes to it, open a terminal window, go to the directory that
contains <tt>Makefile</tt>, and run the command

<pre>
    make
</pre>

<p>
The output of this command should look something like this:

<pre>
    gcc -g -DLWDIR=\"/home/physionet/html/lightwave\" -DLWVER=\"0.43\" -DLW_WFDB=\""/usr/local/database http://physionet.org/physiobank/database"\" server/lightwave.c -o lightwave -lcgi -lwfdb
    mkdir -p /home/physionet/cgi-bin
    cp -p lightwave /home/physionet/cgi-bin
    rm -f lightwave *~ */*~ */*/*~
    mkdir -p /home/physionet/html/lightwave
    mv client/lightwave.html .
    cp -pr client/* /home/physionet/html/lightwave
    sed s+http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/+/cgi-bin/+ \
     &lt;client/js/lightwave.js &gt;/home/physionet/html/lightwave/js/lightwave.js
    sed "s/\[local\]/0.43/" &lt;lightwave.html &gt;/home/physionet/html/lightwave/index.html
    mv lightwave.html client

    LightWAVE has been installed.  If an HTTP server is running,
    use LightWAVE by opening your web browser and visiting
        http://HOST/lightwave/
    (replacing HOST by the hostname of this server, or by localhost
    or 127.0.0.1 to run without a network connection).
</pre>

<h3>Test the installed server</h3>

<p>
From the <tt>lightwave</tt> directory, run this command:

<pre>
    make test
</pre>

The output of this command should look something like this:

<pre>
    The LightWAVE server appears to be running properly in command-line mode.
    Test it with the LightWAVE client by pointing your web browser to:
        http://localhost/lightwave/
</pre>

<p>
If the test with the LightWAVE client doesn't work at all, check that
Apache (or whatever web server you installed) is running.

<p>
If the LightWAVE client loads, but (after about 10 seconds) displays the
message:

<pre>
    The LightWAVE server at
    http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/lightwave
    is not responding properly.  Please check
    the network connection.  Select another server
    on the Settings tab if necessary.
</pre>

and the suggestions in the message are not sufficient to solve the problem,
check that:

<ul>
<li> <tt>lightwave</tt> (the compiled LightWAVE server) is installed in a
     directory that is named as a directory containing CGI
     applications in the appropriate Apache configuration file
<li> <tt>lightwave</tt> has appropriate ownership and permissions so
     it can be run by Apache
<li> any shared libraries (DLLs) needed by <tt>lightwave</tt>, including
     libcgi, libwfdb, and libcurl, are in locations where Apache can find
     them, and they have appropriate ownership and permissions to
     be read by Apache
</ul>

<h3>Using your locally hosted server</h3>

<p>
If you have a network connection, you may use your server by connecting to
it with a browser and LightWAVE client running on the same host.  The
server will use PhysioBank as its data repository by default.  (This is the
configuration that you tested in the previous section.)

<p>
If you have set up your own data repository (see below) on the same host
as the server, you may use LightWAVE without a network connection, by
connecting to the server with a browser and LightWAVE client also running
on the same host.

<p>
In order to use your server from a different host, the LightWAVE client
must be configured to use it rather than PhysioNet's public server.  To
do this, go to the client's <b>Settings</b> tab and set the server URL to the
location of your server.  This setting will persist only until you reload
the LightWAVE client.  You can change the default server URL by changing
the value of <tt>server</tt> just below the initial comment block in
<tt>client/js/lightwave.js</tt>;  this change will affect all future sessions.

<h3>Custom data repositories</h3>

<p>
The LightWAVE server, in common with all applications that use the
WFDB library (<tt>libwfdb</tt>), finds data by searching a list of
locations (data repositories) known as the <em>WFDB path</em>.  The
standard list of locations is determined at the time the LightWAVE
server is compiled, by the value of the constant <tt>LW_WFDB</tt>.
This constant is defined in <tt>Makefile</tt> as

<pre>
    /usr/local/database http:/physionet.org/physiobank/database
</pre>

<p>
If you wish to use a repository other than PhysioBank:

<ol>
<li> Choose a location for your repository.
  <ul>
  <li> If the repository will be in local storage, the simplest choice is to put
       it in <tt>/usr/local/database</tt> (or the first component of your WFDB
       path, whatever that is).
  <li> Otherwise, add the location of the repository (which can be either a
       location in your local file system, or a URL) to the definition
       of <tt>LW_WFDB</tt> in <tt>Makefile</tt>, and recompile and install the
       server (run "<tt>make</tt>" as above).  Be sure that your repository
       precedes PhysioBank in the WFDB path, or it will not be searched.
  </ul>

<li> Make a copy
     of <a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/DBS">
     http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/DBS</a>.  Use a text
     editor (not a word processor) to edit it so that it includes the
     names of the database(s) in your repository, and put the
     modified <tt>DBS</tt> in the top-level directory of your
     repository.  Important:  database names may not include spaces!

<li> Make a copy
     of <a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/wfdbcal">
     http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/wfdbcal</a>.  If your
     records include signal types that are not listed in it, use a
     text editor to add them.  Put the modified <tt>wfdbcal</tt> in
     the top-level directory of your repository.

<li> For each database in your repository, make a subdirectory of your
     repository's top-level directory, with the name that you entered
     in <tt>DBS</tt>.  Within the subdirectory:
  <ul>
  <li> Store the <a href="http://physionet.org/faq.shtml#physiobank-formats">
       PhysioBank-compatible records</a> for your database.
  <li> Create plain text files named <tt>RECORDS</tt> (containing a list of
       record names) and <tt>ANNOTATORS</tt> (containing a list of annotator
       names), using those in the PhysioBank databases as models.
  </ul>
</ol>

<p> Note that, on specific request, the LightWAVE server will read sets of
annotations that are not listed in the <tt>ANNOTATORS</tt> file.  The current
LightWAVE client does not provide a user interface for specifying an unlisted
annnotation set, however;  as a result, annotation sets are not readily
accessible unless their annotator names are listed in <tt>ANNOTATORS</tt>.
It is harmless (though slightly inefficient) to list annotator names for
non-existent annotation sets in <tt>ANNOTATORS</tt>.  Make an empty
<tt>ANNOTATORS</tt> file if your database is unannotated.

<p>
Notice that although your LightWAVE client lets you choose which LightWAVE
<em>server</em> it uses, it does not let you choose which <em>data
repositories</em> the server uses (since, by design, this is determined when the
server is compiled, not at run-time).  If you wish to use non-standard
repositories, this can be done only by configuring your own LightWAVE server to
do so.

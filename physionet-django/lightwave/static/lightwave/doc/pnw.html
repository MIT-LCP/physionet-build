<p style="color: red">
This page describes features that are not yet implemented on PhysioNetWorks!
</p>

<p> <a href="https://physionet.org/users/">PhysioNetWorks</a> workspaces are
available to members of the PhysioNet community for works in progress that will
be made publicly available via PhysioNet when complete. Unlike other areas of
PhysioNet, these workspaces are password-protected.

<p> LightWAVE can provide access to PhysioBank-compatible data within
PhysioNetWorks projects to which you belong.

<p> <b>Follow these steps to set up access:</b>

<ol>
<li> If you are the owner of a private or shared PhysioNetWorks project
that contains compatible data, go to your project's <em>Manage</em> page and
click on <button>Enable LightWAVE access</button>.  Follow the instructions to
complete the setup.  Repeat this step for any other private or shared projects
with compatible data.

<li> From your PhysioNetWorks home page, click on <button>Refresh LightWAVE
configuration</button>.

<li> In the future, when you upload additional compatible data into one of your
projects, go to its <em>Manage</em> page and click on <button>Refresh LightWAVE
index</button>.
</ol>

<p><b>Follow these steps to view PhysioNetWorks data:</b>

<ol>
<li>
There are two ways to access compatible data in PhysioNetWorks via LightWAVE:

<ul>
<li> Launch the preconfigured LightWAVE for PhysioNetWorks client at
<a href="https://physionet.org/users/shared/lightwave/">https://physionet.org/users/shared/lightwave/</a>.

<li> Launch the standard LightWAVE client at
<a href="http://physionet.org/lightwave/">http://physionet.org/lightwave/</a>
or any desired custom version of it, and enter the URL of the LightWAVE for
PhysioNetWorks server
(<a href="https://physionet.org/pnw/a/lightwave">https://physionet.org/pnw/a/lightwave/</a>)
as the server on the client's <em>Settings</em> tab.
</ul>

<li> Log in to PhysioNetWorks if you haven't done so already.
</ol>

We hosted the PLAGH-MIT clinical data conference and health datathon at the People's Liberation Army General Hospital in Beijing, China on October 21-22, 2016. To our knowledge, there has been no other datathon addressing cross-disciplinary healthcare research in China. More than a thousand conference attendance requests were received on the first day of registration. The organizers visited several departments of their hospital in order to recruit clinicians for the datathon. The biggest recruitment challenge was that clinicians were not clear about their role in the datathon and had difficulty envisioning how to interface with data scientists with expertise in machine learning and signal processing.

The datathon centered around the MIMIC-III. Research projects were proposed by PLAGH clinicians prior to the event, and reviewed by both PLAGH and MIT teams, in order to assess their suitability. Two of the final six project were: “Total fluid balance and mortality in elderly critically ill patients” and “Serum NT-proBNP level and the duration of mechanical ventilation”. In the end, each of the six teams were able to extract their selected variables including the outcome of interest, and perform a preliminary analysis. The expert panel gave feedback regarding each team’s choice of covariates and data models, and suggested follow up methodologies to further their clinical projects. The winning team, which investigated red blood cell transfusion, presented their coding framework which allowed them to quickly visualize the effects of adding, removing, and controlling for confounders. This framework was well received as a useful tool with which clinicians can explore the database.

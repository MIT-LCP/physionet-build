The goal of the contest is to stimulate effort and advance the state of the art in this clinically significant problem, and to foster both friendly competition and wide-ranging collaborations. We will award prizes of US$500 to the most successful entrant in each of two events.<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/#1\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Data for development and evaluation</h3>\n\n<p>Data for this contest have kindly been provided by Dr. Thomas Penzel of Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany, and are available <a href=\"/content/apnea-ecg/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The data to be used in the contest are divided into a <em>learning set</em> and a <em>test set</em> of equal size. Each set consists of 35 recordings, containing a single ECG signal digitized at 100 Hz with 12-bit resolution, continuously for approximately 8 hours (individual recordings vary in length from slightly less than 7 hours to nearly 10 hours). Each recording includes a set of reference annotations, one for each minute of the recording, that indicate the presence or absence of apnea during that minute. These reference annotations were made by human experts on the basis of simultaneously recorded respiration signals. Note that the reference annotations for the test set will not be made available until the conclusion of the contest. Eight of the recordings in the learning set include three respiration signals (oronasal airflow measured using nasal thermistors, and chest and abdominal respiratory effort measured using inductive plethysmography) each digitized at 20 Hz, and an oxygen saturation signal digitzed at 1 Hz. These additional signals can be used as reference material to understand how the apnea annotations were made, and to study the relationships between the respiration and ECG signals.</p>\n\n<p>The database does not contain episodes of pure central apnea or of Cheyne-Stokes respiration; all apneas in these recordings are either obstructive or mixed. Minutes containing hypopneas (defined as intermittent drops in respiratory flow below 50%, accompanied by drops in oxygen saturation of at least 4%, and followed by compensating hyperventilation) are also scored as minutes containing apnea. Additional information about the recordings was posted <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/apnea-ecg/additional-information.txt\">here</a> after the conclusion of the competition, including (for all recordings) age, gender, height, weight, AI (apnea index), HI (hypopnea index), and AHI (apnea-hypopnea index). The subjects of these recordings are men and women between 27 and 63 years of age, with weights between 53 and 135 kg (BMI between 20.3 and 42.1); AHI ranges from 0 to 93.5 in these recordings.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Sleep apnea definitions</h3>\n\n<p>Several definitions for clinically significant sleep apnea have been in clinical use since 1978, when Guilleminault defined &quot;sleep apnea syndrome&quot; as more than 30 apneas per night. In 1981, Lavie proposed a more selective criterion of 100 apneas per night. Later criteria were based on an &quot;apnea index&quot; (the number of apneas per hour, or the number of minutes containing apnea per hour). Most clinicians regard an apnea index below 5 as normal, and an apnea index of 10 or more as pathologic. In 1988, He et al. found increased mortality in untreated patients with apnea indices of 20 or more, and such patients are now recognized as in need of treatment. Criteria used in current practice rely not only on an apnea index, but also on symptoms and cardiovascular sequelae.<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/#2\"><sup>2</sup></a></p>\n\n<h3>Data classes</h3>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this challenge, based on these varied criteria, we have defined three classes of recordings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Class A (Apnea)</strong>: These meet all criteria. Recordings in class A contain at least one hour with an apnea index of 10 or more, and at least 100 minutes with apnea during the recording. The learning and test sets each contain 20 class A recordings.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Class B (Borderline)</strong>: These meet some but not all of the criteria. Recordings in class B contain at least one hour with an apnea index of 5 or more, and between 5 and 99 minutes with apnea during the recording. The learning and test sets each contain 5 class B recordings.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Class C (Control)</strong>: These meet none of the criteria, and may be considered normal. Recordings in class C contain fewer than 5 minutes with apnea during the recording. The learning and test sets each contain 10 class C recordings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Events and scoring</h3>\n\n<p>Each entrant may compete in one or both of the following events:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Apnea screening</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this event, your task is to design software that can classify the 35 test set recordings into class A (apnea) and class C (control or normal) groups, using the ECG signal to determine if significant sleep apnea is present. Your classifications for the 5 class B (borderline) recordings will not influence your score in this event (but you must classify them into either class A or class C, since you will not know which records belong to class B until the correct classifications of the 35 test set records are disclosed after the end of the contest). Your score for this event is simply the number of correct classifications; thus the maximum score possible is 30.</p>\n\n<p>An example may help to clarify the scoring: A contestant submits her results, classifying 22 recordings in class A and 13 in class C (for a total of 35). Out of the 22 recordings that her software has identified as class A, 16 of them are actually class A, 3 are class B and 3 are class C. Out of the 13 recordings that her software identified as class C, 7 have been correctly identified, and other 6 include 4 class A and 2 class B. The score in this case is 23 (16 correct class A identifications, plus 7 in class C). Class B cases do not contribute to the final score; rather, they provide a buffer zone between the cut of classes A and C.</p>\n\n<p>We have chosen to exclude the class B recordings from the calculation of the scores because the utility of a screening test depends primarily on the accuracy with which it classifies the unambiguous cases, both positive and negative (classes A and C respectively in this instance). If you wish to attempt to classify recordings into all three groups, you may submit a second set of classifications, and we will calculate your score in the same way (but the maximum possible score in this case will be 35). The highest scores obtained in this way will be published, but will not be the basis for an award.</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. Quantitative assessment of apnea</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this event, your software must generate a minute-by-minute annotation file for each recording, in the same format as those provided with the learning set, using the ECG signal to determine when sleep apnea occurs. Your annotations will be compared with a set of reference annotations to determine your score. Each annotation that matches a reference annotation earns one point; thus the highest possible score for this event will be approximately 16800 (480 annotations in each of 35 records). It is important to understand that scores approaching the maximum are very unlikely, since apnea assessment can be very difficult even for human experts. Nevertheless, the scores can be expected to provide a reasonable ranking of the ability of the respective algorithms to mimic the decisions made by human experts.</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Obtaining scores</h3>\n\n<p>A form that will permit you to submit your classifications and/or annotations for scoring is now available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/apnea-ecg/challenge/\">here</a>. You will receive a reference number and your score(s) by return e-mail. You may revise your submissions and try again if you wish, but attempts to exploit this service in order to discover the correct classifications are contrary to the spirit of the contest and will result in disqualification.</p>\n\n<h3>How to enter</h3>\n\n<p>To enter the competition, submit an abstract with a concise description of your approach to the problem to <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu\">Computers in Cardiology 2000</a> no later than Wednesday, 3 May 2000. Your abstract must include your reference number and score(s); for this reason, do not wait until the last minute to submit your classifications and/or annotations for scoring. If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page paper for presentation during the conference and publication in the conference proceedings. We welcome and encourage contributions to PhysioNet of software developed during this competition.</p>\n\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n\n<p>The author(s) of the top-scoring eligible entry in each event will receive an award of US$500 in recognition of his or her achievement. In the event of a tie, the date of the author&#39;s abstract submission will be the tie-breaker. This rule favors early submission of abstracts, but permits authors to improve their results if they can after submitting their abstracts. Classifications or annotations received for scoring after noon GMT on Friday, 22 September 2000 will not be eligible for awards. Submissions from members and affiliates of our research groups at MIT, Boston University, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, McGill University, and Phillips-University are not eligible for awards, although all are welcome to participate.</p>\n\n<h3>Workshop/Panel discussion</h3>\n\n<p>All entrants are invited to describe their methods during a panel discussion at Computers in Cardiology in Boston on Sunday, 24 September 2000, when the awards will be given. Individual presentations of accepted papers will be scheduled for one or more sessions of the conference during the following days (25-27 September).</p>\n\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n\n<p><a>1.</a> Funding for the awards has been contributed by the <a href=\"http://reylab.bidmc.harvard.edu\">Margret and H.A.

The score is the total number of correct classifications of the 20 class A (apnea) and 10 class C (control/no apnea) recordings, so that the maximum possible score is 30. Since four entrants achieved a perfect score, the date of the top-scoring entrant&#39;s submission is the tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<p>The top scores in event 1 are:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Score</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entrant</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Date</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entries</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/m9-3.htm\">MR Jarvis and PP Mitra</a><br>\n\t\t\tCaltech, Pasadena, CA, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-4.htm\">B Raymond, R Cayton, R Bates, and M Chappell</a><br>\n\t\t\tBirmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, UK</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-3.htm\">P de Chazal, C Henehan, E Sheridan, R Reilly, P Nolan, and M O&#39;Malley</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity College - Dublin, Ireland</td>\n\t\t\t<td>17 July</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-4.htm\">J McNames, A Fraser, and A Rechtsteiner</a><br>\n\t\t\tPortland State University, Portland, OR, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>29/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-5.htm\">PK Stein and PP Domitrovich</a><br>\n\t\t\tWashington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-5.htm\">JE Mietus, C-K Peng, PCh Ivanov, and AL Goldberger</a><br>\n\t\t\tBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA (unofficial entry)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>27 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-6.htm\">Z Shinar, A Baharav, and S Akselrod</a><br>\n\t\t\tTel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel</td>\n\t\t\t<td>29 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-1.htm\">MJ Drinnan, J Allen, P Langley, and A Murray</a><br>\n\t\t\tFreeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-2.htm\">C Maier, M Bauch, and H Dickhaus</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Heidelberg, Heilbronn, Germany</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-2.htm\">M Schrader, C Zywietz, V von Einem, B Widiger, G Joseph</a><br>\n\t\t\tMedical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany</td>\n\t\t\t<td>7 August</td>\n\t\t\t<td>8</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>27/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-3.htm\">C Marchesi, M Paoletti, S Di Gaetano</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Firenze, Firenze, Italy</td>\n\t\t\t<td>28 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>27/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-1.htm\">M Ballora, L Glass, B Pennycook, PCh Ivanov, and AL Goldberger</a><br>\n\t\t\tMcGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada (unofficial entry)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Each entrant&#39;s best score is shown, along with the date when they achieved that score. Many entrants submitted multiple entries, and the &#39;Entries&#39; shown indicate how many entries were submitted by each entrant up to and including the one that scored highest (later entries, and entries that did not receive scores because of formatting errors were not counted); this gives some sense of how much &#39;tuning&#39; may have taken place. Entries noted as &#39;unofficial&#39; came from two of the PhysioNet core research groups, and were therefore not eligible for awards, although they followed all of the rules of the competition.</p>\n\n<p>Only one entry, from PK Stein, was submitted for an unofficial &#39;three-way score&#39; (the total of correct classifications of all 35 records, including the 5 class B (borderline) records). This is a significantly more difficult task, since the amount of apnea in the class B records must be accurately determined in order to classify them correctly, and recognizing apnea in recordings that have only small amounts of apnea is more difficult than in recordings with frequent apneas. The single entry received a score of 33/35, an excellent result; the only errors occurred when a class A record was put in class B, and a class B record was put in class A.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 2 (Apnea Quantification)</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this event, each minute of each of the 35 recordings in the test set must be classified as containing apnea (A) or not (N).

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>Following the success of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/\">first Computers in Cardiology Challenge</a>, we are pleased to offer a new challenge from PhysioNet and <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology 2001</a>. The challenge is to develop a fully automated method to predict the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF), based on the ECG prior to the event. The goal of the contest is to stimulate effort and advance the state of the art in this clinically significant problem, and to foster both friendly competition and wide-ranging collaborations.</p>\n\n<h3>Data for development and evaluation</h3>\n\n<p>PhysioNet provides free access to a set of data to be used for development and evaluation of algorithms. The <a href=\"/content/afpdb\">PAF Prediction Challenge Database</a> consists of 100 pairs of half-hour ECG recordings. Each pair of recordings is obtained from a single 24-hour ECG. Subjects in group A experienced PAF; for these subjects, one recording ends just before the onset of PAF, and the other recording is distant in time from any PAF (there is no PAF within 45 minutes before or after the excerpt). Subjects in group N do not have PAF; in these, the times of the recordings have been chosen at random.</p>\n\n<p>The database is divided into a <em>learning set</em> and a <em>test set</em> of equal size, each containing approximately equal numbers of subjects from groups A and N. The classifications of the recordings in the learning set are provided; those for the test set will be revealed after the conclusion of the challenge.</p>\n\n<h3>Events and scoring</h3>\n\n<p>We will award prizes of US$500 to the most successful entrant in each of two events:</p>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><strong>Event 1: PAF screening</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Event 1 is intended to determine if subjects in group A can be distinguished from those in group N. (In other words, can individuals at risk of PAF be identified within a larger population, based on their ECGs?) The number of correctly classified subjects (0 to 50) is the event 1 score.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Event 2: PAF prediction</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Event 2 is intended to determine if subjects in group A have distinctive and detectable changes in their ECGs immediately before PAF. (In other words, is the imminent onset of PAF predictable in an individual known to be at risk of PAF?) A successful method for doing so should be able to determine which record of each pair of group A records immediately precedes PAF. If the identities of the group A records were known, it would be sufficient to classify these records only; since the goal of event 1 is to identify group A, however, we have not provided this information! Entrants in event 2 of the challenge must therefore classify exactly one of each pair of records in the test set as `A&#39; (defined as ``immediately preceding PAF, if the patient belongs to group A&#39;&#39;), and the other as `N&#39; (defined as ``not immediately preceding PAF&#39;&#39;). One point is awarded for each correctly classified record pair, so that the event 2 scores range from <em>n</em> to 50 (the lower bound is <em>n</em>, the number of subjects in group N, because the group N subjects are always considered correctly classified).</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>If a tie occurs in either event, the date of the submission is the tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<h3>How to enter</h3>\n\n<p>To enter the competition:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Develop an algorithm for classifying the test set recordings. The algorithm must perform this task unaided (manual and semiautomated methods are not eligible).</li>\n\t<li>Submit your classifications to PhysioNet for scoring (click <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/afpdb/challenge/\">here</a> for detailed instructions).</li>\n\t<li>Submit an abstract with a concise description of your approach and results to <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology 2001</a>. (<strong>Deadline: 1 May 2001</strong>). Please submit your abstract using the category <strong>ECG: Arrhythmia</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page paper for presentation during the conference and publication in the conference proceedings. We welcome and encourage contributions to PhysioNet of software developed during this competition.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to improve your score, you may revise your entry and submit it again for scoring. The number of submissions is limited (you will be allowed six entries, which may be all in one event, or divided between the two events as you wish). If you wish to submit additional entries, the autoscorer will enforce a waiting period, which is 24 hours for the seventh entry and doubles for every subsequent entry.</p>\n\n<p>If you have submitted an abstract to Computers in Cardiology 2001 on or before 1 May 2001, you are eligible for awards based on any scores you receive before the challenge deadline of noon GMT on Friday, 21 September 2001.</p>\n\n<p>If you have not submitted an abstract on or before 1 May, you may still participate in the challenge as an unofficial entrant, but you will not be eligible for an award. If you achieve a high score, it will appear in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/top-scores.shtml\">list of top scores</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Links</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/afpdb/\">PAF Prediction Challenge Database</a>.

The top score and the award in event 1 was obtained by G&uuml;nther Schreier and colleagues of the Austrian Research Centers Seibersdorf (Graz, Austria). In event 2, the top score was obtained by Wei Zong and colleagues at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA); because this entry came from one of the PhysioNet core research groups, however, it was unofficial, and the award in event 2 was given to the team with the highest official score, who were once again G&uuml;nther Schreier and colleagues. We congratulate and thank all of the participants in this challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The immediate goal of the Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2001 was to develop a fully automated method to predict the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF), based on the ECG prior to the event. Entrants developed and tested methods using a database created for this challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The test set of the <a href=\"/content/afpdb/\">PAF Prediction Challenge Database</a> consists of 50 pairs of half-hour ECG recordings. Each pair of recordings is obtained from a single 24-hour ECG. Subjects in group A experienced PAF; for these subjects, one recording ends just before the onset of PAF, and the other recording is distant in time from any PAF (there is no PAF within 45 minutes before or after the excerpt). Subjects in group N do not have PAF; in these, the times of the recordings have been chosen at random. Entrants were told that between 20 and 30 of the 50 subjects belong to each group; the exact size of each group (28 in group A, 22 in group N) was disclosed only after the conclusion of the challenge in September.</p>\n\n<p>Brief descriptions of the methods used can be viewed by following the links in the tables below to abstracts submitted by many of the entrants for presentation at Computers in Cardiology 2001; please note that these abstracts were written no later than May 2001, and do not mention results achieved since then. For details on the CinC Challenge 2001, follow the links at the bottom of this page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 1 (PAF Screening)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Event 1 was intended to determine if subjects in group A can be distinguished from those in group N. (In other words, can individuals at risk of PAF be identified within a larger population, based on their ECGs?) The number of correctly classified subjects (0 to 50) is the event 1 score. The best methods were able to achieve roughly 80% classification accuracy on the test set.</p>\n\n<p>The top scores in event 1 are:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Score</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entrant</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Date</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entries</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>41/50<br>\n\t\t\t82%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-6.htm\">G Schreier, P Kastner, and W Marko</a><br>\n\t\t\tAustrian Research Centers Seibersdorf, Graz, Austria</td>\n\t\t\t<td>17 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>8</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>40/50<br>\n\t\t\t80%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-4.htm\">W Zong and RG Mark</a><br>\n\t\t\tHarvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA (unofficial entry)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>7</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>37/50<br>\n\t\t\t74%</td>\n\t\t\t<td>R Sweeney and colleagues<br>\n\t\t\tGuidant Corp., St. Paul, MN, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>8 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>36/50<br>\n\t\t\t72%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-5.htm\">C Maier, M Bauch, and H Dickhaus</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Applied Sciences, Heilbronn, Germany</td>\n\t\t\t<td>19 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>35/50<br>\n\t\t\t70%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-7.htm\">C Marchesi and M Paoletti</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversit&agrave; di Firenze, Firenze, Italy</td>\n\t\t\t<td>27 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>34/50<br>\n\t\t\t68%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/p73-3.htm\">KS Lynn and HD Chiang</a><br>\n\t\t\tCornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>28 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>33/50<br>\n\t\t\t66%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/p73-2.htm\">CC Yang</a><br>\n\t\t\tNational Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan</td>\n\t\t\t<td>21 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>33/50<br>\n\t\t\t66%</td>\n\t\t\t<td>JA Kors<br>\n\t\t\tErasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10 July</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>32/50<br>\n\t\t\t64%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-2.htm\">P de Chazal and C Heneghan</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia</td>\n\t\t\t<td>13 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>32/50<br>\n\t\t\t64%</td>\n\t\t\t<td>R Loesch</td>\n\t\t\t<td>14 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Each entrant&#39;s best score is shown, along with the date when they achieved that score. Many entrants submitted multiple entries, and the &#39;Entries&#39; shown indicate how many entries were submitted by each entrant up to and including the one that scored highest (later entries, and entries that did not receive scores because of formatting errors were not counted); this gives some sense of how much &#39;tuning&#39; may have taken place. The entry noted as &#39;unofficial&#39; came from one of the PhysioNet core research groups, and was therefore not eligible for awards, although the entrant followed all of the rules of the competition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 2 (PAF Prediction)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Event 2 was intended to determine if subjects in group A have distinctive and detectable changes in their ECGs immediately before PAF. (In other words, is the imminent onset of PAF predictable in an individual known to be at risk of PAF?) A successful method for doing so should be able to determine which record of each pair of group A records immediately precedes PAF. If the identities of the group A records were known, it would be sufficient to classify these records only; since the goal of event 1 was to identify group A, however, we did not provide this information! Entrants in event 2 of the challenge therefore were required to classify exactly one of each pair of records in the test set as `A&#39; (defined as ``<em>immediately preceding PAF, if the patient belongs to group A</em>&#39;&#39;), and the other as `N&#39; (defined as ``<em>not immediately preceding PAF</em>&#39;&#39;). One point was awarded for each correctly classified record pair, so that the raw event 2 scores range from <em>22</em> to 50 (the lower bound is <em>22</em>, the number of subjects in group N, because the group N subjects are always considered correctly classified). In the table below, the scores have been adjusted by subtraction of 22 from the raw scores, so that the adjusted scores can range between 0 and 28.</p>\n\n<p>The top scores in event 2

The goal of the contest is to stimulate effort and advance the state of the art in this clinically significant problem, and to foster both friendly competition and wide-ranging collaborations. We will award prizes of US$500 to the most successful entrant in each of two events.<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/#1\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Data for development and evaluation</h3>\n\n<p>Data for this contest have kindly been provided by Dr. Thomas Penzel of Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany, and are available <a href=\"/content/apnea-ecg/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The data to be used in the contest are divided into a <em>learning set</em> and a <em>test set</em> of equal size. Each set consists of 35 recordings, containing a single ECG signal digitized at 100 Hz with 12-bit resolution, continuously for approximately 8 hours (individual recordings vary in length from slightly less than 7 hours to nearly 10 hours). Each recording includes a set of reference annotations, one for each minute of the recording, that indicate the presence or absence of apnea during that minute. These reference annotations were made by human experts on the basis of simultaneously recorded respiration signals. Note that the reference annotations for the test set will not be made available until the conclusion of the contest. Eight of the recordings in the learning set include three respiration signals (oronasal airflow measured using nasal thermistors, and chest and abdominal respiratory effort measured using inductive plethysmography) each digitized at 20 Hz, and an oxygen saturation signal digitzed at 1 Hz. These additional signals can be used as reference material to understand how the apnea annotations were made, and to study the relationships between the respiration and ECG signals.</p>\n\n<p>The database does not contain episodes of pure central apnea or of Cheyne-Stokes respiration; all apneas in these recordings are either obstructive or mixed. Minutes containing hypopneas (defined as intermittent drops in respiratory flow below 50%, accompanied by drops in oxygen saturation of at least 4%, and followed by compensating hyperventilation) are also scored as minutes containing apnea. Additional information about the recordings was posted <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/apnea-ecg/additional-information.txt\">here</a> after the conclusion of the competition, including (for all recordings) age, gender, height, weight, AI (apnea index), HI (hypopnea index), and AHI (apnea-hypopnea index). The subjects of these recordings are men and women between 27 and 63 years of age, with weights between 53 and 135 kg (BMI between 20.3 and 42.1); AHI ranges from 0 to 93.5 in these recordings.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Sleep apnea definitions</h3>\n\n<p>Several definitions for clinically significant sleep apnea have been in clinical use since 1978, when Guilleminault defined &quot;sleep apnea syndrome&quot; as more than 30 apneas per night. In 1981, Lavie proposed a more selective criterion of 100 apneas per night. Later criteria were based on an &quot;apnea index&quot; (the number of apneas per hour, or the number of minutes containing apnea per hour). Most clinicians regard an apnea index below 5 as normal, and an apnea index of 10 or more as pathologic. In 1988, He et al. found increased mortality in untreated patients with apnea indices of 20 or more, and such patients are now recognized as in need of treatment. Criteria used in current practice rely not only on an apnea index, but also on symptoms and cardiovascular sequelae.<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/#2\"><sup>2</sup></a></p>\n\n<h3>Data classes</h3>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this challenge, based on these varied criteria, we have defined three classes of recordings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Class A (Apnea)</strong>: These meet all criteria. Recordings in class A contain at least one hour with an apnea index of 10 or more, and at least 100 minutes with apnea during the recording. The learning and test sets each contain 20 class A recordings.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Class B (Borderline)</strong>: These meet some but not all of the criteria. Recordings in class B contain at least one hour with an apnea index of 5 or more, and between 5 and 99 minutes with apnea during the recording. The learning and test sets each contain 5 class B recordings.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Class C (Control)</strong>: These meet none of the criteria, and may be considered normal. Recordings in class C contain fewer than 5 minutes with apnea during the recording. The learning and test sets each contain 10 class C recordings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Events and scoring</h3>\n\n<p>Each entrant may compete in one or both of the following events:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Apnea screening</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this event, your task is to design software that can classify the 35 test set recordings into class A (apnea) and class C (control or normal) groups, using the ECG signal to determine if significant sleep apnea is present. Your classifications for the 5 class B (borderline) recordings will not influence your score in this event (but you must classify them into either class A or class C, since you will not know which records belong to class B until the correct classifications of the 35 test set records are disclosed after the end of the contest). Your score for this event is simply the number of correct classifications; thus the maximum score possible is 30.</p>\n\n<p>An example may help to clarify the scoring: A contestant submits her results, classifying 22 recordings in class A and 13 in class C (for a total of 35). Out of the 22 recordings that her software has identified as class A, 16 of them are actually class A, 3 are class B and 3 are class C. Out of the 13 recordings that her software identified as class C, 7 have been correctly identified, and other 6 include 4 class A and 2 class B. The score in this case is 23 (16 correct class A identifications, plus 7 in class C). Class B cases do not contribute to the final score; rather, they provide a buffer zone between the cut of classes A and C.</p>\n\n<p>We have chosen to exclude the class B recordings from the calculation of the scores because the utility of a screening test depends primarily on the accuracy with which it classifies the unambiguous cases, both positive and negative (classes A and C respectively in this instance). If you wish to attempt to classify recordings into all three groups, you may submit a second set of classifications, and we will calculate your score in the same way (but the maximum possible score in this case will be 35). The highest scores obtained in this way will be published, but will not be the basis for an award.</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. Quantitative assessment of apnea</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this event, your software must generate a minute-by-minute annotation file for each recording, in the same format as those provided with the learning set, using the ECG signal to determine when sleep apnea occurs. Your annotations will be compared with a set of reference annotations to determine your score. Each annotation that matches a reference annotation earns one point; thus the highest possible score for this event will be approximately 16800 (480 annotations in each of 35 records). It is important to understand that scores approaching the maximum are very unlikely, since apnea assessment can be very difficult even for human experts. Nevertheless, the scores can be expected to provide a reasonable ranking of the ability of the respective algorithms to mimic the decisions made by human experts.</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Obtaining scores</h3>\n\n<p>A form that will permit you to submit your classifications and/or annotations for scoring is now available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/apnea-ecg/challenge/\">here</a>. You will receive a reference number and your score(s) by return e-mail. You may revise your submissions and try again if you wish, but attempts to exploit this service in order to discover the correct classifications are contrary to the spirit of the contest and will result in disqualification.</p>\n\n<h3>How to enter</h3>\n\n<p>To enter the competition, submit an abstract with a concise description of your approach to the problem to <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu\">Computers in Cardiology 2000</a> no later than Wednesday, 3 May 2000. Your abstract must include your reference number and score(s); for this reason, do not wait until the last minute to submit your classifications and/or annotations for scoring. If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page paper for presentation during the conference and publication in the conference proceedings. We welcome and encourage contributions to PhysioNet of software developed during this competition.</p>\n\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n\n<p>The author(s) of the top-scoring eligible entry in each event will receive an award of US$500 in recognition of his or her achievement. In the event of a tie, the date of the author&#39;s abstract submission will be the tie-breaker. This rule favors early submission of abstracts, but permits authors to improve their results if they can after submitting their abstracts. Classifications or annotations received for scoring after noon GMT on Friday, 22 September 2000 will not be eligible for awards. Submissions from members and affiliates of our research groups at MIT, Boston University, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, McGill University, and Phillips-University are not eligible for awards, although all are welcome to participate.</p>\n\n<h3>Workshop/Panel discussion</h3>\n\n<p>All entrants are invited to describe their methods during a panel discussion at Computers in Cardiology in Boston on Sunday, 24 September 2000, when the awards will be given. Individual presentations of accepted papers will be scheduled for one or more sessions of the conference during the following days (25-27 September).</p>\n\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n\n<p><a>1.</a> Funding for the awards has been contributed by the <a href=\"http://reylab.bidmc.harvard.edu\">Margret and H.A.

The score is the total number of correct classifications of the 20 class A (apnea) and 10 class C (control/no apnea) recordings, so that the maximum possible score is 30. Since four entrants achieved a perfect score, the date of the top-scoring entrant&#39;s submission is the tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<p>The top scores in event 1 are:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Score</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entrant</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Date</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entries</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/m9-3.htm\">MR Jarvis and PP Mitra</a><br>\n\t\t\tCaltech, Pasadena, CA, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-4.htm\">B Raymond, R Cayton, R Bates, and M Chappell</a><br>\n\t\t\tBirmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, UK</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-3.htm\">P de Chazal, C Henehan, E Sheridan, R Reilly, P Nolan, and M O&#39;Malley</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity College - Dublin, Ireland</td>\n\t\t\t<td>17 July</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-4.htm\">J McNames, A Fraser, and A Rechtsteiner</a><br>\n\t\t\tPortland State University, Portland, OR, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>29/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-5.htm\">PK Stein and PP Domitrovich</a><br>\n\t\t\tWashington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-5.htm\">JE Mietus, C-K Peng, PCh Ivanov, and AL Goldberger</a><br>\n\t\t\tBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA (unofficial entry)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>27 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-6.htm\">Z Shinar, A Baharav, and S Akselrod</a><br>\n\t\t\tTel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel</td>\n\t\t\t<td>29 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-1.htm\">MJ Drinnan, J Allen, P Langley, and A Murray</a><br>\n\t\t\tFreeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-2.htm\">C Maier, M Bauch, and H Dickhaus</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Heidelberg, Heilbronn, Germany</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-2.htm\">M Schrader, C Zywietz, V von Einem, B Widiger, G Joseph</a><br>\n\t\t\tMedical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany</td>\n\t\t\t<td>7 August</td>\n\t\t\t<td>8</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>27/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-3.htm\">C Marchesi, M Paoletti, S Di Gaetano</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Firenze, Firenze, Italy</td>\n\t\t\t<td>28 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>27/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-1.htm\">M Ballora, L Glass, B Pennycook, PCh Ivanov, and AL Goldberger</a><br>\n\t\t\tMcGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada (unofficial entry)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Each entrant&#39;s best score is shown, along with the date when they achieved that score. Many entrants submitted multiple entries, and the &#39;Entries&#39; shown indicate how many entries were submitted by each entrant up to and including the one that scored highest (later entries, and entries that did not receive scores because of formatting errors were not counted); this gives some sense of how much &#39;tuning&#39; may have taken place. Entries noted as &#39;unofficial&#39; came from two of the PhysioNet core research groups, and were therefore not eligible for awards, although they followed all of the rules of the competition.</p>\n\n<p>Only one entry, from PK Stein, was submitted for an unofficial &#39;three-way score&#39; (the total of correct classifications of all 35 records, including the 5 class B (borderline) records). This is a significantly more difficult task, since the amount of apnea in the class B records must be accurately determined in order to classify them correctly, and recognizing apnea in recordings that have only small amounts of apnea is more difficult than in recordings with frequent apneas. The single entry received a score of 33/35, an excellent result; the only errors occurred when a class A record was put in class B, and a class B record was put in class A.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 2 (Apnea Quantification)</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this event, each minute of each of the 35 recordings in the test set must be classified as containing apnea (A) or not (N).

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>Following the success of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/\">first Computers in Cardiology Challenge</a>, we are pleased to offer a new challenge from PhysioNet and <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology 2001</a>. The challenge is to develop a fully automated method to predict the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF), based on the ECG prior to the event. The goal of the contest is to stimulate effort and advance the state of the art in this clinically significant problem, and to foster both friendly competition and wide-ranging collaborations.</p>\n\n<h3>Data for development and evaluation</h3>\n\n<p>PhysioNet provides free access to a set of data to be used for development and evaluation of algorithms. The <a href=\"/content/afpdb\">PAF Prediction Challenge Database</a> consists of 100 pairs of half-hour ECG recordings. Each pair of recordings is obtained from a single 24-hour ECG. Subjects in group A experienced PAF; for these subjects, one recording ends just before the onset of PAF, and the other recording is distant in time from any PAF (there is no PAF within 45 minutes before or after the excerpt). Subjects in group N do not have PAF; in these, the times of the recordings have been chosen at random.</p>\n\n<p>The database is divided into a <em>learning set</em> and a <em>test set</em> of equal size, each containing approximately equal numbers of subjects from groups A and N. The classifications of the recordings in the learning set are provided; those for the test set will be revealed after the conclusion of the challenge.</p>\n\n<h3>Events and scoring</h3>\n\n<p>We will award prizes of US$500 to the most successful entrant in each of two events:</p>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><strong>Event 1: PAF screening</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Event 1 is intended to determine if subjects in group A can be distinguished from those in group N. (In other words, can individuals at risk of PAF be identified within a larger population, based on their ECGs?) The number of correctly classified subjects (0 to 50) is the event 1 score.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Event 2: PAF prediction</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Event 2 is intended to determine if subjects in group A have distinctive and detectable changes in their ECGs immediately before PAF. (In other words, is the imminent onset of PAF predictable in an individual known to be at risk of PAF?) A successful method for doing so should be able to determine which record of each pair of group A records immediately precedes PAF. If the identities of the group A records were known, it would be sufficient to classify these records only; since the goal of event 1 is to identify group A, however, we have not provided this information! Entrants in event 2 of the challenge must therefore classify exactly one of each pair of records in the test set as `A&#39; (defined as ``immediately preceding PAF, if the patient belongs to group A&#39;&#39;), and the other as `N&#39; (defined as ``not immediately preceding PAF&#39;&#39;). One point is awarded for each correctly classified record pair, so that the event 2 scores range from <em>n</em> to 50 (the lower bound is <em>n</em>, the number of subjects in group N, because the group N subjects are always considered correctly classified).</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>If a tie occurs in either event, the date of the submission is the tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<h3>How to enter</h3>\n\n<p>To enter the competition:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Develop an algorithm for classifying the test set recordings. The algorithm must perform this task unaided (manual and semiautomated methods are not eligible).</li>\n\t<li>Submit your classifications to PhysioNet for scoring (click <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/afpdb/challenge/\">here</a> for detailed instructions).</li>\n\t<li>Submit an abstract with a concise description of your approach and results to <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology 2001</a>. (<strong>Deadline: 1 May 2001</strong>). Please submit your abstract using the category <strong>ECG: Arrhythmia</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page paper for presentation during the conference and publication in the conference proceedings. We welcome and encourage contributions to PhysioNet of software developed during this competition.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to improve your score, you may revise your entry and submit it again for scoring. The number of submissions is limited (you will be allowed six entries, which may be all in one event, or divided between the two events as you wish). If you wish to submit additional entries, the autoscorer will enforce a waiting period, which is 24 hours for the seventh entry and doubles for every subsequent entry.</p>\n\n<p>If you have submitted an abstract to Computers in Cardiology 2001 on or before 1 May 2001, you are eligible for awards based on any scores you receive before the challenge deadline of noon GMT on Friday, 21 September 2001.</p>\n\n<p>If you have not submitted an abstract on or before 1 May, you may still participate in the challenge as an unofficial entrant, but you will not be eligible for an award. If you achieve a high score, it will appear in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/top-scores.shtml\">list of top scores</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Links</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/afpdb/\">PAF Prediction Challenge Database</a>.

The top score and the award in event 1 was obtained by G&uuml;nther Schreier and colleagues of the Austrian Research Centers Seibersdorf (Graz, Austria). In event 2, the top score was obtained by Wei Zong and colleagues at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA); because this entry came from one of the PhysioNet core research groups, however, it was unofficial, and the award in event 2 was given to the team with the highest official score, who were once again G&uuml;nther Schreier and colleagues. We congratulate and thank all of the participants in this challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The immediate goal of the Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2001 was to develop a fully automated method to predict the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF), based on the ECG prior to the event. Entrants developed and tested methods using a database created for this challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The test set of the <a href=\"/content/afpdb/\">PAF Prediction Challenge Database</a> consists of 50 pairs of half-hour ECG recordings. Each pair of recordings is obtained from a single 24-hour ECG. Subjects in group A experienced PAF; for these subjects, one recording ends just before the onset of PAF, and the other recording is distant in time from any PAF (there is no PAF within 45 minutes before or after the excerpt). Subjects in group N do not have PAF; in these, the times of the recordings have been chosen at random. Entrants were told that between 20 and 30 of the 50 subjects belong to each group; the exact size of each group (28 in group A, 22 in group N) was disclosed only after the conclusion of the challenge in September.</p>\n\n<p>Brief descriptions of the methods used can be viewed by following the links in the tables below to abstracts submitted by many of the entrants for presentation at Computers in Cardiology 2001; please note that these abstracts were written no later than May 2001, and do not mention results achieved since then. For details on the CinC Challenge 2001, follow the links at the bottom of this page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 1 (PAF Screening)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Event 1 was intended to determine if subjects in group A can be distinguished from those in group N. (In other words, can individuals at risk of PAF be identified within a larger population, based on their ECGs?) The number of correctly classified subjects (0 to 50) is the event 1 score. The best methods were able to achieve roughly 80% classification accuracy on the test set.</p>\n\n<p>The top scores in event 1 are:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Score</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entrant</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Date</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entries</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>41/50<br>\n\t\t\t82%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-6.htm\">G Schreier, P Kastner, and W Marko</a><br>\n\t\t\tAustrian Research Centers Seibersdorf, Graz, Austria</td>\n\t\t\t<td>17 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>8</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>40/50<br>\n\t\t\t80%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-4.htm\">W Zong and RG Mark</a><br>\n\t\t\tHarvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA (unofficial entry)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>7</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>37/50<br>\n\t\t\t74%</td>\n\t\t\t<td>R Sweeney and colleagues<br>\n\t\t\tGuidant Corp., St. Paul, MN, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>8 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>36/50<br>\n\t\t\t72%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-5.htm\">C Maier, M Bauch, and H Dickhaus</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Applied Sciences, Heilbronn, Germany</td>\n\t\t\t<td>19 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>35/50<br>\n\t\t\t70%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-7.htm\">C Marchesi and M Paoletti</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversit&agrave; di Firenze, Firenze, Italy</td>\n\t\t\t<td>27 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>34/50<br>\n\t\t\t68%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/p73-3.htm\">KS Lynn and HD Chiang</a><br>\n\t\t\tCornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>28 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>33/50<br>\n\t\t\t66%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/p73-2.htm\">CC Yang</a><br>\n\t\t\tNational Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan</td>\n\t\t\t<td>21 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>33/50<br>\n\t\t\t66%</td>\n\t\t\t<td>JA Kors<br>\n\t\t\tErasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10 July</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>32/50<br>\n\t\t\t64%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-2.htm\">P de Chazal and C Heneghan</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia</td>\n\t\t\t<td>13 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>32/50<br>\n\t\t\t64%</td>\n\t\t\t<td>R Loesch</td>\n\t\t\t<td>14 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Each entrant&#39;s best score is shown, along with the date when they achieved that score. Many entrants submitted multiple entries, and the &#39;Entries&#39; shown indicate how many entries were submitted by each entrant up to and including the one that scored highest (later entries, and entries that did not receive scores because of formatting errors were not counted); this gives some sense of how much &#39;tuning&#39; may have taken place. The entry noted as &#39;unofficial&#39; came from one of the PhysioNet core research groups, and was therefore not eligible for awards, although the entrant followed all of the rules of the competition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 2 (PAF Prediction)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Event 2 was intended to determine if subjects in group A have distinctive and detectable changes in their ECGs immediately before PAF. (In other words, is the imminent onset of PAF predictable in an individual known to be at risk of PAF?) A successful method for doing so should be able to determine which record of each pair of group A records immediately precedes PAF. If the identities of the group A records were known, it would be sufficient to classify these records only; since the goal of event 1 was to identify group A, however, we did not provide this information! Entrants in event 2 of the challenge therefore were required to classify exactly one of each pair of records in the test set as `A&#39; (defined as ``<em>immediately preceding PAF, if the patient belongs to group A</em>&#39;&#39;), and the other as `N&#39; (defined as ``<em>not immediately preceding PAF</em>&#39;&#39;). One point was awarded for each correctly classified record pair, so that the raw event 2 scores range from <em>22</em> to 50 (the lower bound is <em>22</em>, the number of subjects in group N, because the group N subjects are always considered correctly classified). In the table below, the scores have been adjusted by subtraction of 22 from the raw scores, so that the adjusted scores can range between 0 and 28.</p>\n\n<p>The top scores in event 2

We received many suggestions for challenge topics, and encourage you to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=challenge-topic\"> write to us</a> with further suggestions. We chose the topic for this year&#39;s challenge not only for its intrinsic interest, but also because it is quite different from the previous two challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Heart rate variability has attracted much attention from researchers since the early 1980s. It has long been understood that a metronomic heart rate is pathological, and that the healthy heart is influenced by multiple neural and hormonal inputs that result in variations in interbeat (RR) intervals, at time scales ranging from less than a second to 24 hours. Even after 20 years of study, new analytic techniques continue to reveal properties of the time series of RR intervals. Much research in this area aims to discover or to explain how specific changes in variability can be related to specific pathologies.</p>\n\n<p>Given how much is known about heart rate variability, it might be thought that simulating a realistic sequence of RR intervals would be an easy task. The intricate interdependencies of variations at different scales, however, make it difficult to create a simulation of sufficient realism to mislead an experienced observer, and it may be even harder to deceive a program designed to quantify these subtle features.</p>\n\n<p>Each of the figures below shows a 10 hour time series of RR intervals at the same scale (the range of heart rates is roughly 70 to 120 bpm in each case). Can you identify which of these time series is synthetic? (rr1.png and rr2.png)</p>\n\n<p><br>\nIt may be difficult to identify the synthetic data based on the figures; you may download the RR interval time series in text form for <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/rr1.txt\">series 1</a> and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/rr2.txt\">series 2</a> if you wish to inspect the data in more detail. (Click <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/answer.html\">here</a> for the answer.)</p>\n\n<p>Our challenge is therefore twofold: Can you construct a simulation of the RR interval time series spanning a full 24 hours with sufficient verisimilitude to be taken as real? Can you classify a mixed set of real and simulated RR interval time series? As in previous challenges, we awarded prizes of US$500 to the most successful entrant in each of two events.</p>\n\n<h3>Organization of the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>During the first eight weeks of the challenge, participants in event 1 created software that can generate synthetic RR interval time series. Participants entered event 1 of the challenge by submitting a generator (model) in source form by email (see the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/#rules-1\">rules</a> below). The period for submitting entries for event 1 ended at noon GMT on Monday, 22 April 2002; no late entries can be accepted. We created two synthetic 24-hour RR interval time series using each generator entered into the challenge. We also created a number of additional synthetic series using generators not entered into the challenge.</p>\n\n<p>We have provided an approximately equal number of real 24-hour RR interval time series. These were derived from long-term ECG recordings of adults between the ages of 20 and 50 who have no known cardiac abnormalities, similar to those included in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/nsrdb/\">MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database</a>. These recordings typically begin and end in the early morning (within an hour or two of the subject&#39;s awakening). Small numbers of ectopic beats are common in such recordings, as are short intervals of artifacts that may cause false beat detections or missed beat detections. We have excluded recordings with significant amounts of noise or ectopy.</p>\n\n<p>The synthetic and real series have been assigned random identification numbers in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/dataset/\">challenge dataset</a>, which was posted on PhysioNet on Wednesday, 24 April 2002, marking the start of event 2.</p>\n\n<p>Participants in event 2 have classified each series in the challenge dataset as real, synthetic, or unknown (see the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/#rules-2\">rules</a> below). An <a href=\"https://physionet.org/cgi-bin/cinc-2002-score\">autoscorer</a> received entries submitted using a web browser, and returned scores by email to participants.

The qualified participant whose generator produces the most realistic time series, as defined below, received an award of US$500 (see the challenge results).</p>\n\n<p>To avoid bias, the realism of the series was judged by the challenge participants themselves, in event 2. The most recent set of classifications from each qualified participant in event 2 received by noon GMT on 30 April 2002 was used to score the generators. Participants who have entered more than one generator will receive a separate score for each generator.</p>\n\n<p><em>Update (25 February 2002):</em> The overall accuracy, <em>a</em>, of each event 2 participant (defined as the number of correct classifications made by that participant divided by the number of series to be classified) defines a weight</p>\n\n<p><em>w</em> = (<em>a</em> - 0.5)<sup>2</sup> + 0.05</p>\n\n<p>given to that participant&#39;s classifications. Each generator receives 2<em>w</em> points for each &quot;real&quot; classification if <em>a</em> &gt; 0.5, 2<em>w</em> points for each &quot;synthetic&quot; classification if <em>a</em> &le; 0.5, and <em>w</em> points for each &quot;unknown&quot; classification.</p>\n\n<p>To qualify for an award in event 1, a participant must do all of the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Submit a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/#valid-1\">valid entry for event 1</a> no later than noon GMT on Monday, 22 April 2002.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/event-2.shtml\">valid entry for event 2</a> no later than noon GMT on Tuesday, 30 April 2002.</li>\n\t<li>Submit an abstract describing his or her generator to <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology</a>, no later than Friday, 3 May 2002.</li>\n\t<li>Attend Computers in Cardiology 2002, 22-25 September 2002, in Memphis, Tennessee.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Please note point 2 above!</strong> You <em>must</em> enter event 2 in order to qualify for an award in event 1. This rule was intended to insure that participants in event 1 received feedback on the success of their generators before the CinC abstract deadline.</p>\n\n<p>Each participant was allowed to submit up to five generators, and each was treated as a separate entry. Participants were permitted to replace any of their previous entries with an improved version at any time until noon GMT on Monday, 22 April 2002.</p>\n\n<p>A prize of US$500 will be awarded to the qualified participant whose generator has received the highest score. If a tie had occured, scores for the tying generators only would have been recalculated using all classifications (not only the final classifications) from each qualified participant. If a tie had remained, the date and time of submission would have been the final tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<h3>How to Submit a Valid Entry for Event 1</h3>\n\n<p><strong>The deadline for submitting entries for event 1 has passed, and no more entries can be accepted.</strong> If you have missed the deadline, however, we encourage you to submit your generator anyway. If there is sufficient interest, we will rerun the challenge at a later date.</p>\n\n<p>Begin by downloading <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/rrgen.c\">rrgen.c</a>, which contains an example generator.</p>\n\n<p>You will need to write functions in standard (ANSI/ISO) C to replace the initialize and generate functions in the example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>initialize is called once, before generate is called the first time. Its first argument is a 32-bit (long) integer, which will be given a different random value each time this program is run as part of the challenge. Its second argument specifies the length of the simulation, in seconds.</li>\n\t<li>generate is called once per RR interval. It should return the length of the next (simulated) RR interval in seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the challenge, your generator will be used to generate two series that should be different (otherwise they will be rather easy to recognize as synthesized!). Use the arguments to initialize to set up the initial conditions for your simulation. You might use the first argument as a seed for a random number generator as in the example.</p>\n\n<p>If you prefer, you can do the entire simulation within initialize, saving the results to an array; then generate can return one value from the array each time it is invoked by main. Make sure the array is long enough if you take this approach; you can use the second argument of initialize to help determine the array length.</p>\n\n<p>Although the challenge will be based on 24-hour simulations, make sure that your generator can create longer time series (of at least 48 hours).</p>\n\n<p>You may, if necessary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>define additional functions</li>\n\t<li>define global variables</li>\n\t<li>include other ANSI/ISO C standard header (.h) files</li>\n\t<li>allocate memory as needed using malloc or similar functions</li>\n\t<li>invoke other functions from the ANSI/ISO C standard library and math library</li>\n\t<li>create temporary files in the current directory</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you create temporary files, do so within the current directory only, and use file names beginning with temp. Any files created will be removed between runs (you cannot save information from one run to use in another).</p>\n\n<p>You may not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>modify main</li>\n\t<li>write to the standard output (main does this, but your code may not)</li>\n\t<li>use chdir or any other means to change the current directory</li>\n\t<li>invoke fork, system, or any of the exec family of functions to start another program or another process</li>\n\t<li>incorporate portions of real (physiologic) RR interval sequences in the output</li>\n\t<li>incorporate code or data that cannot be made freely available after the conclusion of the Challenge</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All code will be reviewed before being compiled or run. Please keep your code neat. If we can&#39;t figure out what your program does, we won&#39;t run it!</p>\n\n<p>All code must compile cleanly using:</p>\n\n<pre>             gcc -Wall rrgen.c -lm\n</pre>\n\n<p>There must be no errors or warnings of any kind.</p>\n\n<p>Your program must run to completion within a reasonable time. A reasonable time is 1 minute or less for a 24-hour simulation running on a 1 GHz Athlon under Linux; we will not disqualify programs that slightly exceed this limit. For reference, the example program generates 24 hours of simulated data in roughly 0.2 seconds, so if your program is no more than about 300 times slower than the example, it should be fine.</p>\n\n<p>All programs entered will be posted with full credit to their authors on PhysioNet following the conclusion of the Challenge, and will be made freely available under the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt\">GPL</a> (or another <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/\">open source license</a> if you prefer).</p>\n\n<p>Test your entry before submitting it. Don&#39;t forget to include your name, affiliation, and email address in the comment block at the top of the file. Once you are ready, send a copy of your program (source only; do not send binaries) via email to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=rrgen.c\"> webmaster@physionet.org</a> with a subject line of rrgen.c. Please send the source file as plain text, not as HTML or as a word-processor formatted attachment.</p>\n\n<p>Participants received an email confirmation of their entry once it had been reviewed. If a generator failed to meet any of the requirements for a valid entry, participants were advised that the email would indicate in general terms the nature of the problem (e.g., compilation error), but that they would be responsible for debugging their programs. Several entries that arrived shortly before the deadline had very minor problems, which were corrected by the challenge organizer and returned to their authors for review. Each generator that met all requirements for a valid entry was assigned an entry number, which was indicated in the email confirmation.</p>\n\n<h3>Event 2 - Classification</h3>\n\n<p>Participants in this event attempt to determine which members of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/dataset/\">challenge dataset</a> of RR interval time series are synthesized, and which are real.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will classify each series as real, simulated, or unknown, and will submit their classifications to an autoscorer. Scores will be returned by email. Each correct classification increases the score by 2 points, and each incorrect classification reduces the score by 1 point. The qualified participant who received the highest final score (see below) received an award of US$500. Since a tie occurred, the date and time of submission is the tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<p>To qualify for an award in event 2, a participant must do all of the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Submit a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/event-2.shtml\">valid entry for event 2</a> no later than noon GMT on Tuesday, 30 April 2002.</li>\n\t<li>Attend Computers in Cardiology 2002, 22-25 September 2002, in Memphis, Tennessee.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Participants in event 2 were encouraged but not required to submit an abstract describing their methods of classifying the challenge dataset to Computers in Cardiology 2002, no later than Friday, 3 May 2002.</p>\n\n<p>Participants may submit up to five sets of classifications, but only the final score received by each participant will be used to determine the outcome of this event. (Each submission cancels any previous score; scores are not cumulative.) Invalid submissions are not scored and do not count against the limit of five submissions.</p>\n\n<p>If you have missed the 30 April 2002 deadline for submitting your first set of classifications, we still encourage you to participate unofficially. If you receive a high final score, your achievement will be recognized on this web site. If you are able to attend Computers in Cardiology, you will have an opportunity to discuss your work informally with other participants. <a> </a></p>\n\n<p><a> </a> Instructions for submitting an entry to event 2 can be found <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/event-2.shtml\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Important Dates</h3>\n\n<p>All deadlines are at noon GMT unless otherwise indicated. Late entries will not be accepted.</p>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><strong>Monday, 22 April 2002</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Deadline for submission of generators in event 1.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Wednesday, 24 April 2002</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Event 2 begins when the challenge dataset, consisting of the time series to be classified, is posted.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Tuesday, 30 April 2002</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>To qualify for an award in either event, submit a valid entry in event 2 by noon GMT on this date.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Friday, 3 May 2002</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Deadline for submission of abstracts for Computers in Cardiology 2002.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Sunday-Wednesday, 22-25 September 2002</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Computers in Cardiology, Memphis, Tennessee</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Must I enter both events in order to participate?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No. Event 1 is optional. Event 2 is required of all participants.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I&#39;ve entered both events. Do my classifications of my own synthesized series count?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, for both events. If your generator is a good one, you may find it difficult to identify its output, however! Attempts to &quot;watermark&quot; your output so that you can identify it will be rejected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does each synthesized series get its own event 1 score?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each series in the challenge dataset gets a partial score that reflects how it was classified. These will be posted at the conclusion of the challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The partial scores of the two series created using each generator are added to obtain the score for that generator. The generators&#39; scores determine the winner of event 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you change the scoring for event 1?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The weighting factor <em>w</em> was introduced so that a generator gets significantly more credit for misleading a really good classifier than for misleading one whose classifications are no better than random. The values of <em>w</em> are symmetric about <em>a</em> = 0.5 because a classifier who misclassifies everything is clearly able to tell the difference between real and synthesized data despite a fundamental confusion about which is which! We&#39;ve added a small positive bias to <em>w</em> so that even the coin-tossers&#39; contributions will have a (small) effect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the significance of SPS in rrgen.c?</strong></p>\n\n<p>SPS is the sampling frequency (in samples per second), which determines how the RR intervals are quantized. All RR intervals in the real time series have lengths that are exact multiples of (1/SPS) seconds, but these have then been converted to a decimal representation with 3 digits after the decimal point. If SPS is 128, for example, intervals such as 0.992, 1.000, 1.008, 1.016, and 1.023 seconds are possible in the real time series, but intermediate values such as 1.001 or 1.002 do not occur. rrgen&#39;s main function uses SPS in a calculation to ensure that the only RR interval values that appear in the synthesized time series are those that can also occur in the real time series. In most cases, you won&#39;t need to refer to SPS explicitly in your code, but it&#39;s there if you need it.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge dataset may include real series with a variety of sampling frequencies between 120 and 1000 samples per second. The synthesized series in the challenge data set will be produced using generators compiled with a similar variety of SPS values, so that it will not be possible to identify the real series simply by looking at the distribution of &quot;forbidden&quot; RR interval values. (Update 24 April: All of the series use the same sampling frequency, 128 samples per second.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>I&#39;ve already entered event 1 five times, and now I have a better generator. Can I enter it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you have previously received entry numbers for the maximum of five generators, you may enter another generator only if you replace a previously accepted generator. To do this, simply tell us (at the beginning of your new entry) the entry number for the generator you wish to replace (e.g., &quot;This entry should replace entry number 38.&quot;) If your replacement is accepted, it will be assigned a new entry number; otherwise your original entry will remain in the challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There is a limit of 5 trials in event 2, but one can try as many times as one needs, asking friends or using different email addresses. And if there is no limit on the number of trials, since you return immediately the score, one can proceed by trial and error in order to detect what is real and what is not. I wonder if I missed something. </strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are tempted to try submitting many entries in order to learn about the correct classifications, why not play <a href=\"http://www.lizardpoint.com/fun/mastermind/mastmind.html\">Mastermind</a> instead, where such a strategy is rewarded? We will reject obvious attempts to circumvent the spirit of the challenge in this way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How old are the &quot;normal&quot; subjects whose RR interval time series are included in the challenge dataset? Are they active over the 24 hours (e.g., were the recordings taken with an ambulatory monitor) or were they bed-bound (but otherwise healthy)? </strong></p>\n\n<p>The normals are men and women between the ages of 20 and 50, engaged in their usual activities of daily life. Interbeat intervals were obtained using automated analysis (with some manual review and corrections) of ambulatory (Holter) ECG recordings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Could you elaborate on the reference to &quot;manual review and correction&quot; please? I am assuming that the reviewers removed ectopic beats (those with an RR interval &lt;80% or &gt;120% of the previous RR interval) and replaced them with a beat where an expert would have expected one. Should we therefore not worry about generating the odd ectopic beat (or at least removing the odd beat as if an ectopic had occured and an expert/algorithm had removed it without replacing it)? </strong></p>\n\n<p>No, intervals surrounding ectopic beats are not removed or otherwise adjusted in the real time series. The challenge data set includes only series that have very little or no ectopy. Whatever ectopic beats may be present are marked at their times of occurrence, so that you should expect to see (for example) a few short intervals that precede premature atrial or ventricular beats, and long (compensatory) intervals following premature ventricular beats.</p>\n\n<p>The manual review and corrections have been applied to the original ECG recordings, not to the interbeat interval time series. This process typically involves visual inspection of the longest and shortest detected intervals in each case (which tends to reveal not only ectopic beats but also beats that were not detected automatically and detections that were not beats). Ideally, the output of this process includes the times of occurence of each beat, including any ectopic beats. The interbeat interval time series are prepared from these data without further corrections. Update 24 April: Some of the normals have not been manually corrected.</p>\n\n<p>Participants in event 1 should consider these points carefully. You may wish to generate an interbeat interval time series that results from a beat sequence that includes rare isolated ectopic beats and short periods of signal loss.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Results</h3>\n\n<p>This year&#39;s challenge scoring had an unusual twist: scores for event 1 were determined by entries in event 2, and vice versa. The outcome of event 2 was determined very quickly. Rather than continuing both events until 20 September as originally announced, we collected event 2 entries until the deadline for official entrants (noon GMT on 30 April) had passed, and then determined final scores for event 1.</p>\n\n<p>If you did not have a chance to submit an official entry, we encourage you to participate anyway; you can still submit classifications of the challenge dataset and receive an unofficial score. Unofficial event 1 entries are also welcome; if there is sufficient interest, we will run a second round of this challenge, using new RR interval generators and a new dataset.</p>\n\n<p>Winners of each event received awards during September&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology</a> conference, where participants presented their work. The RR interval generators submitted by event 1 participants are available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Brief descriptions of the methods used can be viewed by following the links in the tables below to abstracts submitted by many of the entrants for presentation at Computers in Cardiology 2002.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 1 (generating RR interval series)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The top scorers in event 1 are:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Place</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entry<br>\n\t\t\tnumber</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entrant</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Score</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-192.c\">192</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/s41-5+6.htm\">DC Lin</a><br>\n\t\t\tRyerson University, Toronto, Canada</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3.452</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-171.c\">171</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/s51-5.htm\">Dragan Gamberger, Ivan Maric, Tomislav Smuc, Gordan Bosanac, Nikola Bogunovic, Goran Krstacic</a><br>\n\t\t\tRudjer Boskovic Institute, Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation, Zagreb, Croatia</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1.494</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-142.c\">142</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/s51-2.htm\">Albert C-C Yang, Cheng-Hsi Chang, SS Hseu, Huey-Wen Yien</a><br>\n\t\t\tTaipei Veterans General Hospital<br>\n\t\t\tSchool of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.689</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-201.c\">201</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/s41-1+s51-1.htm\">PE McSharry, GD Clifford</a><br>\n\t\t\tDept Maths &amp; Dept Engineering, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.497</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>5 (tie)</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-153.c\">153</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>Manojit Roy<br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.202</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>5 (tie)</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-161.c\">161</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>Miguel A.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>For the fourth annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge, we propose a provocative question of considerable clinical interest:</p>\n\n<blockquote><strong>Is it possible to tell the difference between transient ST changes in the ECG that are due to myocardial ischemia, and those that are not?</strong></blockquote>\n\n<p>For many years, a simple answer (&quot;no&quot;) was considered to be the final word on this question. Myocardial ischemia results from insufficient oxygen delivery to the myocardium. To diagnose myocardial ischemia definitively, it is necessary to document that blood flow, blood oxygen saturation, or both have been compromised to an extent that the oxygen demands of the myocardium are not satisfied. These diagnostic criteria are typically established by imaging the coronary arteries. Since the ECG does not contain direct information about blood flow or oxygen saturation, it cannot be used to diagnose ischemia.</p>\n\n<p>It may be possible, however, to establish inferential associations between specific features of the ECG and myocardial ischemia. One such association, between transient ischemia and changes in the ST segment of the ECG, is very widely known, and is understood to be highly sensitive, but not specific. It has long been known that repolarization of ischemic myocardial regions is abnormal, that these abnormalities are visible in the ST segment, and that they can be quantified by measuring the deviation of certain portions of the ST segment from baseline measurements. It is also known that deviations in these ST segment measurements can result from a wide variety of other causes, including changes in heart rate, conduction pattern, position of the subject, and noise in the ECG. As a result, observations of transient ST changes are considered suggestive of ischemia but are not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis, absent conclusive evidence from imaging studies.</p>\n\n<p>Even in subjects who are known to have myocardial ischemia, ST changes are not considered a basis for definitive diagnosis of individual episodes of ischemia. In a subject with an old myocardial infarction, for example, the infarct may result in an ST segment with a persistent abnormal pattern (in the frame of reference of the heart). This fixed pattern appears to change with the subject&#39;s body position (upright, supine, etc.) because of movement of the ECG elecrodes relative to the heart. Thus many of those subjects who are most likely to experience ischemia are also among those most likely to have non-ischemic ST changes.</p>\n\n<p>Therapeutic intervention to reduce or eliminate transient ischemic episodes can make a significant difference in quality of life for affected subjects, and may reduce mortality and morbidity in this population. Assessment of the effectiveness of therapy is substantially hindered by the lack of a reliable way of identifying ischemic episodes during activities of daily living, in which imaging studies are not possible. If it were possible to distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic ST changes in ambulatory ECG recordings made during subjects&#39; normal activities, the benefits would be immediate and substantial, in terms of a reduction in the time needed to determine and validate effective therapies, hence in the risk and pain experienced by the affected subjects.</p>\n\n<p>This year&#39;s challenge topic encourages participants to develop novel approaches to analysis of transient ST changes using the recently-completed <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/\">Long-Term ST Database</a>, a meticulously annotated collection of 86 recordings of 2- and 3-lead long-term (20-24 hour) ECGs. Each ST change that meets criteria of clinical significance has been carefully studied by a team of expert annotators, who have drawn upon all available evidence to determine which of these events are consistent with a diagnosis of myocardial ischemia, and which are consistent with other causes. Half of these 86 recordings have been contributed to PhysioNet and are available to participants as a learning set. The remaining recordings form the test set.</p>\n\n<p>Participants are challenged to design and implement algorithms that can closely mimic the decisions made by the expert annotators, classifying the ST changes (events) in the test set as ischemic or non-ischemic. The algorithms are not required to detect the events, but only to classify each given event as ischemic, non-ischemic, or indeterminate.</p>\n\n<h3>Organization of the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>As noted above, the data used for this challenge come from the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/\">Long-Term ST Database</a>. The learning set consists of the 43 records available from PhysioNet. Participants should train their algorithms using these records. The test set consists of the other 43 records.</p>\n\n<p>To enter the challenge, participants will submit their classifiers by email to PhysioNet, where the entries will be compiled and used to classify the ST events in the test set. Each algorithm will receive a score determined by the number of correctly classified events, less the number of incorrectly classified events (those left unclassified will not affect the score). Scores will be returned to participants by email, and high scores will be posted on PhysioNet and updated throughout the challenge period. Participants may revise and resubmit their entries until the challenge deadline of noon GMT on Friday, 12 September 2003.</p>\n\n<p>All participants are encouraged to submit an abstract to Computers in Cardiology 2003 describing their approach to the challenge. (When submitting your abstract, choose the topic &quot;Computers in Cardiology Challenge&quot;.) Abstracts are due on Thursday, 1 May 2003 (note: this deadline has been extended to Thursday, 8 May 2003); details are available on the <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology web site</a>. If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page manuscript (due on Tuesday, 23 September 2003) for publication in the conference proceedings, and you will have the opportunity to discuss your work at the conference. To be eligible for an award, you must submit an abstract and attend the conference.</p>\n\n<p>The eligible participant whose algorithm receives the highest score will receive an award of US$1000, to be presented at <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology 2003</a> (in Thessaloniki, Greece, 21-24 September 2003). A selection of the classifiers will be posted on PhysioNet following the conference.</p>\n\n<h3>Developing an entry</h3>\n\n<p>Use the learning set to develop criteria for classifying the ST events. We recommend that you begin by copying a set of input files for one record of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/\">learning set</a> into an empty local directory. The files that your program will be permitted to read are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the header (.hea) and signal (.dat) files, permitting access to the digitized ECG signals;</li>\n\t<li>the beat annotation (.atr) and ST measurement (.16a) files, providing QRS times of occurrence for each beat, and continuously updated ST-segment measurements based on 16-beat moving averages;</li>\n\t<li>the .stf file, containing the ST level, reference, and deviation for each input signal, at two-second intervals throughout the recording</li>\n\t<li>the .klt file (decompressed from the .klt.zip files available on-line), containing time series of ST and QRS principal components</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, your program will need to have a copy of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2003/epi-files/\">.epi</a> file for the record. These text files have been prepared for this Challenge from the .stb reference annotation files of the Long-Term ST Database; they contain the times of significant ST changes, but not the classifications of those events. Your program is not expected to detect the events, but to classify them, so this file is available to substitute for an ST change detector.</p>\n\n<p>Your program may use any or all of these files as a basis for classifying the ST events. In principle, all of the other files are derivable from the signal (.dat) file, but you are not expected to do so! The other files are provided for use as shortcuts to a solution of the challenge problem; in a clinical application, it would be necessary to integrate the code needed to detect and classify the QRS complexes, measure the ST deviations, and detect the ST events.</p>\n\n<p>For example, to work with record s30701 of the learning set, download</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.hea\">s30701.hea</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.dat\">s30701.dat</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.atr\">s30701.atr</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.16a\">s30701.16a</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.stf\">s30701.stf</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.klt.zip\">s30701.klt.zip</a> (decompress this using unzip, pkzip, winzip or a similar utility)</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2003/epi-files/s30701.epi\">s30701.epi</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last of these files, s30701.epi, is derived from s30701.stb; it contains:</p>\n\n<pre>  1 40125 2 ?\n  2 40129 1 ?\n  3 64361 0 ?\n  4 64361 1 ?\n  5 76639 2 ?\n  6 76647 1 ?\n  7 77171 2 ?\n  8 77551 2 ?\n  9 79967 1 ?\n 10 79975 2 ?\n</pre>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each line contains information about one event. From left to right, the columns contain an event ID number, the time of the event (the elapsed time from the beginning of the record, in seconds), the signal number (0, 1, or 2) of the affected ECG signal, and the classification of the event, where &#39;?&#39; means &#39;indeterminate&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of each run, your program must have copied the .epi file into a .epo file, replacing the &#39;?&#39; placeholders with its classifications. Use &#39;I&#39; to mark ischemic and &#39;N&#39; to mark non-ischemic events; you may leave indeterminate events marked with &#39;?&#39;. For example, the correct classifications for record s30701 are:</p>\n\n<pre>  1 40125 2 N\n  2 40129 1 N\n  3 64361 0 N\n  4 64361 1 N\n  5 76639 2 I\n  6 76647 1 I\n  7 77171 2 I\n  8 77551 2 I\n  9 79967 1 I\n 10 79975 2 I\n</pre>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thus, the first four ST changes in this example are non-ischemic (in s30701.sta, the expert annotators have marked them as due to axis shift), and the remaining six are consistent with ischemia.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>Your program&#39;s score will be determined by comparing the output .epo files with a set of reference .epr files. The .epr files are identical to the .epi files, except that the classification of each ST event, based on the .stb annotations, is included in place of the &#39;?&#39; markers. A point is added to your score for each match (I/I or N/N), and a point is deducted for each mismatch (I/N or N/I). ST events left unclassified (&#39;?&#39;) do not affect your score. (A set of .epr files for the learning set is available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2003/epr-files/\">here</a> for use while you are developing your classifier. The .epr files for the test set are not available; don&#39;t ask!)</p>\n\n<p>The number of events per record varies considerably, from fewer than ten to several hundred. To avoid giving undue weight in the score to the handful of records that have a majority of the events, the .epr files for the test set contain no more than 20 events each (which have been chosen at random from all of the events in those records with more than 20 annotated events). Only these events will be used as the basis for scoring the entries; the others will not be counted. The same set of .epr files will be used to score all entries.</p>\n\n<h3>How to Enter</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Begin by downloading <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2003/stclass.c\">stclass.c</a> (to be used unmodified) and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2003/analyze.c\">analyze.c</a> (to be used as a template for your entry).</li>\n\t<li>You will need to write functions in standard (ANSI/ISO) C to replace the initialize, analyze, and finalize functions in analyze.c:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>initialize is called once, before analyze is called the first time, and before any of the input files have been opened. Use this function to set up any variables needed by your classifier.</li>\n\t\t<li>analyze is called once per ST event. Its inputs are an event ID number, which starts at 1 for the first ST event in each record and is incremented by 1 for each subsequent event; the time of the event (elapsed time in seconds); and the signal number (0, 1, or 2) of the affected signal. In each run, all of the ST changes identified by the expert annotators within a single record will be presented to the analyze function in time order.</li>\n\t\t<li>finalize is called once, after all of the input files been closed. Your algorithm&#39;s classifications are recorded immediately after finalize exits.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Use label (defined in stclass.c) to record your classifications.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>label accepts two input arguments. The first is an event ID number, and the second is the label you wish to assign to that event (&#39;I&#39;, &#39;N&#39;, or &#39;?&#39;). You can invoke label to mark any of the events at any time (so, for example, you can invoke label from your analyze function if you wish to label the events one at a time, or you can invoke label once per event from your finalize function after accumulating information about all of the events. Your algorithm can relabel any event by invoking label a second (or third, ...) time with the same event ID. Any events that you do not label are marked as &#39;?&#39;.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>You may, if necessary:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>define additional functions</li>\n\t\t<li>define global variables</li>\n\t\t<li>include other ANSI/ISO C standard header (.h) files</li>\n\t\t<li>allocate memory as needed using malloc or similar functions</li>\n\t\t<li>invoke other functions from the ANSI/ISO C standard library and math library, and from the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB library</a></li>\n\t\t<li>write to the standard output or the standard error output (for debugging purposes)</li>\n\t\t<li>create temporary files in the current directory</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<p>If you create temporary files, do so within the current directory only, and use file names beginning with temp. Any files created will be removed between runs (you cannot save information from one run to use in another).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>You may not:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>modify main or any other part of stclass.c</li>\n\t\t<li>use chdir or any other means to change the current directory</li>\n\t\t<li>invoke fork, system, or any of the exec family of functions to start another program or another process</li>\n\t\t<li>incorporate code or data that cannot be made freely available after the conclusion of the Challenge</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>All code will be reviewed before being compiled or run. Please keep your code neat. If we can&#39;t figure out what your program does, we won&#39;t run it!</li>\n\t<li>All code must compile cleanly using:\n\t<pre>             gcc -Wall stclass.c -lm -lwfdb\n</pre>\n\tThere must be no errors or warnings of any kind. See the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB Software Package</a> for information about the WFDB library.\n\n\t<p>If your program does not make use of the .dat, .atr or .16a files, it can be compiled without the WFDB library using:</p>\n\n\t<pre>\t     gcc -Wall -DNOWFDB stclass.c -lm\n</pre>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Your program must run to completion within a reasonable time. A reasonable time is 5 minutes or less for a 24-hour record running on a 1 GHz Athlon under Linux; we will not disqualify programs that slightly exceed this limit.</li>\n\t<li>Test your entry before submitting it. Don&#39;t forget to include your name, affiliation, and email address in the comment block at the top of analyze.c. Once you are ready, send a copy of your version of analyze.c (source only; do not send binaries) via email to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=analyze.c\"> webmaster@physionet.org</a> with a subject line of analyze.c. Please send analyze.c as plain text, not as HTML or as a word-processor formatted attachment.</li>\n\t<li>You will receive an email confirmation of your entry once it has been reviewed. If an entry fails to meet any of the requirements for a valid entry, the email will indicate in general terms the nature of the problem (e.g., compilation error), but you are responsible for debugging your entry. Each valid entry will be assigned an entry number, which will be indicated in the email confirmation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once your entry has been given a number, we will run it on the test set and you will receive a score by return email. The top scores will be posted on PhysioNet and will be updated as new entries arrive. You may revise and resubmit your entry if you wish; note, however, that the challenge organizers will give priority to new participants, so that there may be a delay in receiving scores for revised entries.</p>\n\n<p>We will continue to accept entries until noon GMT on Friday, 12 September 2003. All valid entries submitted before this deadline will be scored.</p>\n\n<p>At Computers in Cardiology 2003 (in Thessaloniki, Greece, 21-24 September 2003), a prize of US$1000 will be awarded to the top-scoring eligible participant.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>The fifth annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge focusses on this question:</p>\n\n<blockquote><strong>Is it possible to predict if (or when) an episode of atrial fibrillation will end spontaneously? </strong></blockquote>\n\n<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common serious cardiac arrhythmia, affecting more than two million people in the US alone. Unlike venticular fibrillation, which is invariably fatal if it is not interrupted, it is possible for atrial fibrillation to be sustained indefinitely, since the ventricles continue to perform the essential function of driving the circulation, albeit inefficiently. The risks of sustained atrial fibrillation are nevertheless serious, and include strokes and myocardial infarctions caused by the formation of blood clots within stagnant volumes in the atria. Evidence suggests that spontaneously terminating (paroxysmal) atrial fibrillation, or PAF, is a precursor to the development of sustained AF.</p>\n\n<p>Although spontaneously terminating episodes of AF are often very short (perhaps a few seconds in duration), it is interesting to note that longer episodes lasting several minutes also occur. These appear to be very similar to sustained (non-terminating) AF. Subtle changes in rhythm during the final minutes or seconds of such episodes may lead to (or predict) termination of AF. Improved understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous termination of atrial fibrillation may lead to improvements in treatment of sustained AF. If it were possible to recognize the conditions under which PAF is likely to self-terminate, it might also be possible to intervene in affected individuals to increase the likelihood of self-termination of what would otherwise be sustained AF.</p>\n\n<h3>Organization of the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>The fifth in our annual series of challenges was announced on 23 September 2003 at Computers in Cardiology in Chalkidiki, Greece. At that time, we posted a collection of 80 digitized ECG recordings, the <a href=\"/content/aftdb/\">AF Termination Challenge Database</a>, containing labelled training data and unlabelled test data, to support this challenge. To enter the challenge, you will need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>develop methods to classify the unlabelled test data</li>\n\t<li>send your classifications to PhysioNet for scoring no later than Saturday, 1 May 2004 at noon GMT</li>\n\t<li>send an abstract describing your methods and discussing your findings to Computers in Cardiology no later than 7 May 2004</li>\n\t<li>(optionally) send up to 4 revised entries per event (see below), no later than Tuesday, 14 September 2004 at noon GMT</li>\n\t<li>(optionally) submit the source code for your classifier, no later than Wednesday, 15 September 2004 at noon GMT.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Details are below.</p>\n\n<p>If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page manuscript (due on Tuesday, 21 September 2004) for publication in the conference proceedings, and you will have the opportunity to discuss your work at the conference. To be eligible for an award, you must submit an abstract and attend the conference.</p>\n\n<p>We invite you to submit the source code for your classifier for possible posting on PhysioNet. One of PhysioNet&#39;s major goals is to foster the creation and free dissemination of high-quality software for research on clinically and scientifically interesting subjects. Software contributed in the course of previous challenges has stimulated new collaborations among its authors, and offers rare opportunities to compare the strengths of varied approaches objectively. We will select well-constructed submissions and will post them with full credit to their authors on PhysioNet. We encourage you to participate in this activity as part of the challenge, and we offer additional awards to the authors of the most successful algorithms submitted. A selection of these algorithms will be posted on PhysioNet following the conference.</p>\n\n<p>As in most of our previous challenges, there are two events, and you are welcome to participate in either or both of them. Up to four awards of US$250 will be presented during a plenary session of Computers in Cardiology in September. The top-scoring particpant in each event will receive an award of US$250, and the top-scoring participant among those who have submitted the source code for their classifiers in each event will receive an award of US$250. Qualified participants may receive more than one award.</p>\n\n<p>Although your initial classifications are due by 1 May 2004, you may attempt to improve your results by submitting a limited number of revised entries, until the final deadline of Wednesday, 15 September 2004. The participants who have achieved the best scores on or before the deadline are the winners of each event.</p>\n\n<h3>The challenge database</h3>\n\n<p>The 80 recordings in the AF Termination Challenge Database are each one minute in length (excerpted from longer recordings),and each contains two simultaneously recorded ECG signals. The cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation in each case. QRS annotations produced by an automated detector are included for the convenience of those who may wish to study the interbeat interval time series rather than (or in addition to) the ECG signals themselves; note, however, that these annotation sets are unaudited and contain small numbers of errors. Each of the 80 records belongs to one of three groups:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Group N</strong>: non-terminating AF (defined as AF that was not observed to have terminated for the duration of the long-term recording, at least an hour following the segment).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Group S</strong>: AF that terminates one minute after the end of the record.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Group T</strong>: AF that terminates immediately (within one second) after the end of the record.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These groups are distributed across a <a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/aftdb/learning-set/\"> learning set</a> (consisting of 10 labelled records from each group) and two test sets. <a>Test set A</a> contains 30 records, of which about one-half are from group N, and of which the remainder are from group T. <a>Test set B</a> contains 20 records, 10 from each of groups S and T. The challenge is to identify the group to which each of the test set records belongs.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>&nbsp;</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Group N</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Group S</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Group T</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Learning set</th>\n\t\t\t<td>n01, n02, ... n10</td>\n\t\t\t<td>s01, s02, ... s10</td>\n\t\t\t<td>t01, t02, ... t10</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Test set A</th>\n\t\t\t<td>about 15 records</td>\n\t\t\t<td>-</td>\n\t\t\t<td>about 15 records</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Test set B</th>\n\t\t\t<td>-</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10 records</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10 records</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>How to enter</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Develop an algorithm for classifying the recordings in test set A or B (or both).

Don&#39;t submit HTML documents, MS Word .doc files, or anything else except plain text; the autoscorer won&#39;t like it!</p>\n\n<p>Valid entries must also include a classification for each record in the event that you are entering. There are 30 records in test set A (event 1) and 20 in test set B (event 2). Incomplete entries are rejected.</p>\n\n<p>For each event, you may submit up to five valid entries; any further entries in that event are invalid and will be rejected. Only your top-scoring entry in each event determines your standing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But I can get five more entries using my friend&#39;s email address!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The autoscorer won&#39;t recognize that ... but the challenge organizers will. Please respect the spirit of the challenge. As we have advised in previous challenges, if you are tempted to submit many entries in order to discover the correct classifications, try playing <a href=\"http://www.lizardpoint.com/fun/mastermind/mastmind.html\">Mastermind</a> instead!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are the scores determined?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The score is the number of correct classifications (so a higher score is always better). The maximum possible scores are 30 for event 1 and 20 for event 2. If there is a tie in any event, the award will go to the first participant to submit a top-scoring entry in that event.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Several records appear to include segments that do not appear to be AF. Is there really AF throughout?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The segments were chosen very carefully and with reference to the entire 24-hour recordings from which they were extracted. In a few cases, there are segments with the appearance of low atrial ectopic rhythm that are in fact AF; this appears to be the case in s09 and t09 (from the learning set). Records a24 (from test set A) and b06 (from test set B) begin with sinus rhythm. Record b09 (in test set B) does not contain sinus rhythm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I enter the challenge using a semi-automated method?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You are welcome to participate unofficially (by submitting results for scoring and by submitting an abstract to Computers in Cardiology), but semi-automated methods are not eligible for awards. Please <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=semiautomated\">send a brief note</a> to let us know what you are doing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why don&#39;t you have a challenge about ...?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each year, we receive many suggestions for challenge topics. We encourage you to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=challenge-topic\"> write to us</a> with further suggestions.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Results</h3>\n\n<p>Over twenty teams participated in this year&#39;s Challenge, on the topic of predicting if (or when) an episode of atrial fibrillation will self-terminate.</p>\n\n<p>During September&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology</a> conference, we presented four awards to eligible participants in this year&#39;s challenge. In each event, an overall best award went to the top-scoring team, and a &quot;best open source&quot; award went to the top-scoring team among those who contributed the source code for their entries. The overall award in event 1 was presented to Dieter Hayn and his colleagues, and the overall award in event 2, as well as the &quot;best open source&quot; awards in both events, were won by Federico Cantini and his colleagues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>challenge-2004.jpg</strong> shows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Left to right: Steve Swiryn, George Moody, Simona Petrutiu, Federico Cantini, Dieter Hayn.</blockquote>\n\n<p>We wish to thank all those who participated in the challenge and in the lively and illuminating discussions during the scientific sessions of Computers in Cardiology.

    "abstract": "<p>The seventh annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge addresses a question of high clinical interest:<strong> </strong>Can the QT interval be measured by fully automated methods with an accuracy acceptable for clinical evaluations?</p>",
    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>The seventh annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge addresses a question of high clinical interest:</p>\n\n<blockquote><strong>Can the QT interval be measured by fully automated methods with an accuracy acceptable for clinical evaluations? </strong></blockquote>\n\n<p>The Expert Working Group (Efficacy) of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) has developed and has given its final (&quot;step 4&quot;) endorsement in May, 2005 to a set of guidelines (ICH E14) for clinical evaluation of QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for non-antiarrhythmic drugs. Quoting from that document:</p>\n\n<blockquote>An undesirable property of some non-antiarrhythmic drugs is their ability to delay cardiac repolarization, an effect that can be measured as prolongation of the QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). The QT interval represents the duration of ventricular depolarization and subsequent repolarization, and is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. A delay in cardiac repolarization creates an electrophysiological environment that favors the development of cardiac arrhythmias, most clearly torsade de pointes (TdP), but possibly other ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well. TdP is a polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia that appears on the ECG as continuous twisting of the vector of the QRS complex around the isoelectric baseline. A feature of TdP is pronounced prolongation of the QT interval in the supraventricular beat preceding the arrhythmia. TdP can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, leading to sudden death.\n<p>While the degree of QT prolongation is recognized as an imperfect biomarker for proarrhythmic risk, in general there is a qualitative relationship between QT prolongation and the risk of TdP, especially for drugs that cause substantial prolongation of the QT interval. Because of its inverse relationship to heart rate, the measured QT interval is routinely corrected by means of various formulae to a less heart rate dependent value known as the QTc interval. It is not clear, however, whether arrhythmia development is more closely related to an increase in the absolute QT interval or QTc. Most drugs that have caused TdP clearly increase both the absolute QT and the QTc (hereafter called QT/QTc). Documented cases of TdP (fatal and non-fatal) associated with the use of a drug have resulted in the withdrawal from the market of several drugs and relegation of other drugs to second-line status. Because prolongation of the QT/QTc interval is the ECG finding associated with the increased susceptibility to these arrhythmias, an adequate pre-marketing investigation of the safety of a new pharmaceutical agent should include rigorous characterization of its effects on the QT/QTc interval.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On first consideration, QT interval measurement in the ECG might seem a rather worked-out problem. In comparison with manual methods, automated methods offer advantages in terms of absolute repeatability of measurements, immunity from errors related to observer fatigue, lapses of attention, and transcription, as well as efficiency and cost considerations that permit either more extensive and rigorous testing for the same cost as manual methods, or more rapid testing at lower cost. An extensive literature documents a wide variety of approaches to the problem.</p>\n\n<p>This topic has acquired renewed importance, however, as regulatory agencies worldwide are moving toward requiring &quot;thorough QT/QTc studies&quot; (as defined in the ICH E14 guidelines) as part of clinical trials for all newly developed drugs. ICH E14 guidelines have been adopted and published by the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/6922fnl.pdf\">US FDA</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.emea.eu.int/pdfs/human/ich/000204en.pdf\">EU&#39;s European Medicines Agency</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nihs.go.jp/dig/ich/efficacy/e14/e14_040610_e.pdf\">Japan&#39;s National Institute of Health Services</a>. Among much else, the guidelines endorse manual QT interval measurement for &quot;thorough QT/QTc studies&quot;, and cite the need for further research before the use of fully automated methods can be accepted in these studies:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Several methods for measuring ECG intervals have been used in clinical trials, and for a given trial, the sponsor should describe the accuracy and precision of QT/QTc interval measurements using the selected system. The method chosen will depend on the level of precision appropriate for a given trial. For example, the &quot;thorough QT/QTc study&quot; would warrant particularly careful attention to interval measurement. At present, this would usually involve the measurement by a few skilled readers (whether or not assisted by computer) operating from a centralized ECG laboratory. <em>If well-characterized data validating the use of fully-automated technologies become available, the recommendations in the guidance for the measurement of ECG intervals could be modified.</em> [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus it is clear from the text of the ICH E14 guidelines that regulatory agencies are currently unconvinced of the reliability of automatic QT interval measurements. A major part of the motivation for this year&#39;s challenge is to provide well-characterized data that might support modifications of the ICH E14 recommendations with respect to fully-automated methods.</p>\n\n<p>Independent of these considerations, the QT interval measurements obtained as a product of this Challenge will support further research aimed at designing robust measures of repolarization characteristics. The difficulty of making accurate measurements of QT intervals on individual beats is a hindrance to studies of variability of repolarization (for example, in exercise). By creating a collection of reference QT intervals that have been measured by many expert observers and automated methods, the Challenge can be a starting point for future studies of alternative measurements that may be possible to derive reliably even when QT intervals cannot be determined directly.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Overview</h3>\n\n<p>The Challenge will include separate divisions (and awards) for participants using manual and semi-automated methods (division 1), and fully automated methods (divisions 2 and 3). By doing so, we aim to establish a firm basis for assessing the accuracy and reliability of fully automatic methods for QT interval measurement, as compared to the manual and semi-automated methods currently endorsed by the ICH E14 guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>One of PhysioNet&#39;s major goals is to foster the creation and free dissemination of high-quality open-source software for research on clinically and scientifically interesting subjects. Software contributed in the course of previous Challenges has stimulated new collaborations among its authors, and offers rare opportunities to compare the strengths of varied approaches objectively. Authors of fully automated algorithms may enter division 3 (the &quot;open source&quot; division) by submitting their source code. We encourage participation in this activity as part of the Challenge, and we offer an additional award to the author(s) of the most successful algorithm submitted in source form. We will select well-constructed submissions and will post them with full credit to their authors on PhysioNet following the conclusion of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>As in our previous Challenges, the data needed by participants can be found on PhysioNet. Participants will select a representative beat from each record in the <a href=\"#database\">challenge database</a> and will measure the times of the PQ junction (the Q-wave onset) and the end of the T-wave for that beat, from which the QT interval for that record will be derived by subtraction. Participants will submit entries containing their PQ and T-end measurements to PhysioNet for <a href=\"#scoring\">scoring</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, 20 September 2006, during a plenary session of <a href=\"http://www.cinc2006.upv.es/index.html\">Computers in Cardiology 2006</a> in Valencia, Spain, we will present four <a href=\"#awards\">awards</a> of US$250 each: for the best (lowest) final score overall, and for the best final scores in division 1, divisions 2 and 3, and division 3. <a href=\"#eligible-participants\">Eligible participants</a> may receive more than one award.</p>\n\n<p>Following the conclusion of the challenge, the final sets of reference QT intervals, together with the entire set of submitted PQ and T-end measurements, will be made available on PhysioNet. Among the questions that may be answerable using this set of measurements are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Which records, if any, exhibit clinically significant differences between the medians of the fully automated measurements and those of the manual or semi-automated measurements? (These records would warrant special attention, because they have features likely to confuse either algorithms or humans.)</li>\n\t<li>Which records, if any, exhibit clinically significant differences between the minimum and maximum manually-measured QT intervals? (These would be of interest for the same reason as the previous group; in addition, the incidence of such records would be of interest in establishing the reliability of manual measurements.)</li>\n\t<li>Are there identifiable subsets of the records that are particularly well-measured, or particularly troublesome, for specific algorithms? (These could be valuable in developing an algorithm that incorporates multiple approaches to provide increased accuracy or reliability.)</li>\n\t<li>Do specific algorithms exhibit systematic bias (consistently over- or underestimating QT intervals)? Such a finding might point the way to trivial algorithm changes that might improve accuracy.</li>\n\t<li>Are there clinically significant differences between manual, semi-automated, and fully automated measurements of QT intervals? We hope to show that (at least for a subset of fully automated measurement algorithms) no such differences exist.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Challenge Database</h3>\n\n<p>The data to be used for this year&#39;s challenge are the 549 recordings of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ptbdb/\">PTB Diagnostic ECG Database</a>, which was contributed to PhysioNet in September 2004 by its creators (Michael Oeff, Hans Koch, Ralf Bousseljot, and Dieter Kreiseler of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Berlin). Each of these recordings contains 15 simultaneously recorded signals: the conventional 12 leads and the 3 Frank (XYZ) leads. Each of these is digitized at 1000 samples per second, with 16 bit resolution over a range of &plusmn;16.384 mV. The records come from 294 subjects (each represented by one to five records) with a broad range of ages and diagnoses. About 20% of the subjects are healthy controls. A detailed clinical summary accompanies each record. The records are typically about two minutes in length, with a small number of shorter records (none less than 30 seconds).</p>\n\n<h3>To Participare in the Challenge, You Will Need To</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>develop methods (which may be fully automated, semi-automated, or manual) to locate the PQ junction (the onset of the Q-wave) and the T-wave end of a representative beat in a 12-lead ECG</li>\n\t<li>apply your methods to obtain the times of occurrence of the PQ junction and T-wave end of the first representative beat in each recording in the challenge database</li>\n\t<li>follow the instructions on the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/template.txt\">entry form</a> to submit your results to PhysioNet for scoring</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To make your measurements of each record, choose the first beat that you consider to be representative (not ectopic, and free of significant noise, artifact, and baseline wander in lead II). In lead II, measure to the nearest millisecond the times of the PQ junction (Q-wave onset) and T-wave end, and record these times (i.e., the elapsed times in milliseconds from the beginning of the record) in your <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/template.txt\">entry form</a>. <strong>An illustrated example of this procedure is available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/example.html\">here</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<h3>To be Eligible for an Award, You Will Also Need To</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>submit at least one <a href=\"#eligible-entry\">eligible entry</a> (due Monday, 24 April 2006 at noon GMT)</li>\n\t<li>submit an <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/Submit.htm\">abstract</a> (due Monday, 1 May 2006, and required only for divisions 2 and 3), describing your methods and discussing your findings, to Computers in Cardiology 2006</li>\n\t<li>submit your <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge%202006%20entry%20source\">source</a> code (due Friday, 8 September 2006, and required only for division 3)</li>\n\t<li>submit a four-page <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu/2006/\">manuscript</a> (due Wednesday, 20 September 2006, if your abstract is accepted) for publication in the conference proceedings</li>\n\t<li>attend <a href=\"http://www.cinc2006.upv.es/index.html\">Computers in Cardiology 2006</a>, to be held 17-20 September 2006 in Valencia, Spain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Eligible Entries</strong></p>\n\n<p>Eligible entries must be in plain text format, in the format of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/template.txt\">template</a>. Don&#39;t submit HTML documents, MS Word .doc files, spreadsheets, or anything else except plain text. Be sure to fill in your name, email, and the Challenge division (1, 2, or 3) at the top of the form in the indicated spaces. Follow the instructions on the form to submit your entry.</p>\n\n<p>You may elect to omit measurements for some records. If your automated methods determine that a particular record cannot be measured reliably, omitting measurements for that record may be preferable to supplying unreliable measurements. If your measurements are made manually or semi-automatically, you need not measure all of the records, although it will be to your advantage to measure as many as possible, because of the way the scores are calculated. Entries in division 1 must include measurements for at least 50% (275) of the 549 records in order to be eligible for an award. Entries in the other two divisions require measurements for at least 95% (522) of the records. Qualified participants may receive more than one award.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update: (27 July 2006)</strong> If the time given for the PQ <em>follows</em> that given for the T end in any record, this record is treated as omitted when scores are calculated. If the PQ and T end measurements are not associated with the same beat, this is an error.</p>\n\n<p>You may revise your entry at any time until the final entry deadline of 4 September 2006 at 8 pm (2000) GMT. Each time you do so, your previous entry is discarded. Only the last entry received from each participant on or before the final entry deadline will be used to determine the winners of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exception: (added 13 April 2006)</strong> If you wish to enter independent sets of measurements made using substantially different methods (for example, a set of automated measurements in division 2 or 3, and a set of manual measurements in division 1), at the discretion of the organizers these may be considered simultaneously valid. If you believe that this exception should apply to your entries, please <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge%202006%20multiple%20entries\">write for approval and special instructions</a>, with a brief description of how your methods differ. This approval is not automatic and will require showing that the results of the two methods are significantly different.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>An unusual feature of this Challenge is that the &quot;gold standard&quot; (reference) QT interval measurements that are the basis for scoring each entry will be determined from the entries themselves during the course of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>For each record, the QT interval measurements obtained from the most recent entry submitted by each participant will be pooled to determine a median, which will be taken as the reference QT interval for that record. (<strong>Update 27 July 2006:</strong> Given the large number of division 1 (manual/semiautomated) entries, it is feasible now to determine the medians from the latest entry submitted by each <em>division 1</em> participant, and this has been done for medians and scores calculated on or after 27 July.) The score for each entry will be a function of the amount of agreement with the reference QT intervals and the number of records measured. Reference QT intervals and scores will be calculated at several times during the challenge; they will not be updated each time an entry is received.</p>\n\n<p>The score for each entry will be calculated as the RMS difference between the reference QT intervals and the corresponding QT intervals determined from the times listed in the entry, divided by the fraction of records in the challenge database for which measurements were submitted. Lower scores are better.</p>\n\n<p>Preliminary scores will be provided to participants shortly after the first deadline (24 April 2006), and updates will be supplied from time to time thereafter, each time the reference QT intervals are recalculated. Final scores will be emailed to participants on or about Wednesday, 6 September 2006.</p>\n\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n\n<p>During a plenary session of Computers in Cardiology in September, four awards of US$250 each will be presented to the eligible participants with the best (lowest) final scores as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Best overall (participants in all divisions eligible)</li>\n\t<li>Manual and semi-automated methods (division 1 only)</li>\n\t<li>Fully automated methods (divisions 2 and 3 eligible)</li>\n\t<li>Fully automated methods with source code submitted (division 3 only)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Entering Division 3</h3>\n\n<p>Authors of fully automated methods may enter division 3 by sending their source code by email, before noon GMT on Friday, 8 September 2006, to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge%202006%20entry%20source\">PhysioNet</a>. Use the subject line &quot;Challenge 2006 entry source&quot;, and be sure to include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Your name and email address</li>\n\t<li>All sources needed to produce a working version of your software (except for readily available standard libraries and header files)</li>\n\t<li>A note describing how to produce a working version of your software (a commented Makefile is ideal), and how to run your software</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each source file submitted should begin with a comment block containing the names of its authors and a reference to the open source license you have chosen for it, if any; for example:</p>\n\n<pre>     /* qtpom.c - Find QT intervals based on the phase of the moon\n        Copyright (C) 2006  Herman Foobar\n        This software is released under the terms of the GNU General\n        Public License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).\n     */\n</pre>\n\n<p>Source files in C, C++, Fortran, or Matlab m-code are preferred; other languages may be acceptable, but please ask first. Do not submit any code that cannot be freely redistributed. Note that entries in division 3 are eligible for three of the four awards (best overall, best fully automated method, and best open source method). Good luck!</p>\n\n<h3>Writing Abstracts and Papers for CINC</h3>\n\n<p>To be eligible for awards, participants in divisions 2 and 3 must submit abstracts about their work to Computers in Cardiology; division 1 participants are encouraged but not required to do so.</p>\n\n<p>The abstract due on 1 May 2006 is limited to about 400 words (no figures or tables may be included). For examples of abstracts that have been submitted by participants in past Challenges, see <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2005/cr.html\">these</a> <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2005/rp.html\">two</a> from the 2005 Challenge, or follow links in the top-scores tables for <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/top-scores.shtml\">2000</a>, <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/top-scores.shtml\">2001</a>, <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/top-scores.shtml\">2002</a>, and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2004/top-scores.shtml\">2004</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Abstracts must be submitted on-line on the <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/Submit.htm\">Computers in Cardiology web site</a>. When submitting your abstract, select &quot;Computers in Cardiology Challenge&quot; as the topic on the web form, so that your abstract can be identified easily by the abstract review committee.</p>\n\n<p>Successful abstracts include brief descriptions of the scope of the work, the methods used, the results, and conclusions. If accepted, these abstracts are printed in the scientific program book distributed at the conference, and those for Challenge entries are also posted here. They do not appear in print elsewhere; these are understood to be preliminary in nature and subject to revision between May and September. Nevertheless, you should include whatever preliminary results you have as of the time of the abstract submission; abstracts promising only that &quot;results will be presented&quot; are not accepted.</p>\n\n<p>If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a full 4-page paper describing your work in detail. This paper will have an abstract of its own, considerably shorter than the abstract you submitted for the program book. You can (and should) incorporate relevant results that you obtain during the months between submitting your original abstract and the deadline for the paper in September. You will receive your final score on or about 6 September 2006, about two weeks before your paper is due, so that it can be included in the paper if you wish.</p>\n\n<p>When you are ready to begin writing your paper, get the <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu/authkit/\">Author&#39;s Kit</a>, which includes templates and detailed instructions for preparing your manuscript in the required format and submitting it on-line. Examples of full CinC papers can be found in the Author&#39;s Kit and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/publications/publications-by-journal.shtml#3\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Your paper must be presented in an assigned oral or poster session at Computers in Cardiology in order for it to appear in print in the proceedings of the conference.</p>\n\n<h3>Important Dates</h3>\n\n<p>Late submissions will not be accepted.</p>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><strong>Monday, 24 April 2006, noon GMT</strong></dt>\n\t<dt>&nbsp;</dt>\n\t<dd>Deadline for submission of initial entries to PhysioNet.

Please don&#39;t wait until the last minute!</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p><a> </a></p>\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><a>If your question is not answered below, please consult the </a><a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/faq.shtml\">PhysioNet FAQ</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I download the entire Challenge database in one step?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, but downloading the entire database is not necessary. See the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/faq.shtml#downloading-databases\">PhysioNet FAQ</a> for details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What happens when an entry is submitted?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a>Frequently Asked Questions</a>Once enough entries have been received, we will calculate the median QT interval reported for each record. Since it would be possible for an unscrupulous participant to bias the medians by submitting many entries with the same or slightly different measurements, only the last entry received from each participant is entered into the pool used to determine the medians. See <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/#eligible-entry\">Eligible entries</a> above for an exception to this rule.</p>\n\n<p>The median QT intervals determined in this way become the reference (&quot;gold standard&quot;) against which each participant&#39;s measurements are compared. Since new entries affect the medians, we will calculate new medians from time to time during the challenge, and we will recalculate scores at those times.</p>\n\n<p>Scores will be sent by email whenever new scores are calculated. Participants should expect to receive a preliminary score on or about Wednesday, 26 April 2006 (a few days before the CinC abstract deadline), and a final score on or about Wednesday, 6 September 2006 (about two weeks before the CinC final paper deadline). We expect that additional preliminary scores will be sent to participants at various other times during the spring and summer. Please be sure that your email address as recorded in your entry form is valid so that you will be able to receive your scores.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did the autoscorer reject my entry?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Eligible entries must be in plain text format, as in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/template.txt\">template</a>. Don&#39;t submit HTML documents, MS Word .doc files, spreadsheets, or anything else except plain text; the autoscorer won&#39;t like it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are the scores determined?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are two components of the score. First, we measure the mean of the squared differences between your QT interval measurements and the corresponding reference QT intervals, and take the square root of that number, to obtain the RMS error for your entry. (Since the time units are milliseconds, the units of RMS error are also milliseconds.) Second, we count the number of records measured in your entry, and divide that number by 549 (the total number of records in the challenge database), to obtain the yield for your entry. Your score is your RMS error divided by your yield; since yield is dimensionless, the units of the score are milliseconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do the scores mean, and what&#39;s a good score?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A lower score (ideally obtained with low RMS error and high yield) is always better. The best scores closely reflect the expected difference between a participant&#39;s measurements and the median of a set of manual measurements, in milliseconds. This interpretation of the score may be less appropriate when applied to poor scores, since low yield makes a score worse (higher).</p>\n\n<p>What constitutes a good score is subjective, but (as of 27 July) about a third of the scores in division 1 were near or below 20, and about a third of the division 2 and 3 scores were near or below 30.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can my score be changing if I haven&#39;t revised my measurements?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since the measurements contained in the submitted entries determine the reference QT intervals, your scores are not final until no more entries can be accepted. Preliminary scores based on available entries will be provided from time to time; the first scores will be emailed shortly after the first deadline in April.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I enter the challenge using previously published open-source software for fully automated QT interval measurement?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are the author of the software, yes, certainly!</p>\n\n<p>An entry produced by a functionally identical copy of someone else&#39;s code is not acceptable. If you are not the original author of the software, your entry is acceptable only if you have modified the original code in a non-trivial way, and if your QT interval measurements are no longer identical to those of the original software. It will be very difficult to establish the acceptability of a division 2 entry based on someone else&#39;s open source code, so if you are considering making such an entry, you are strongly encouraged to do so in division 3, where the significance of your modifications can be properly assessed.</p>\n\n<p>This policy is intended to protect the interests of any participants who might wish to publish their code before the conclusion of the Challenge, while still encouraging others to experiment with published algorithms and to contribute improvements to them if they can.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What license should be used for software entered in division 3?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Participants may choose any <a href=\"http://opensource.org/licenses/\">open source license</a> (or none at all). We use and recommend the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\">GPL</a> for our own software posted on PhysioNet, but this is not a requirement for the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I enter the challenge using a semi-automated method?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, you may participate in division 1. We also encourage you to submit an abstract to Computers in Cardiology and to submit your source code for possible posting on PhysioNet, but these are not requirements for division 1 participants.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I select a representative beat manually, and my software locates the PQ junction and T-wave end automatically. Which division should I enter? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Your method is semi-automated, since it requires human input; enter division 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Should I choose the first beat in the record as the representative beat even if the record begins in the middle of the QRS complex?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, definitely not! You should choose the first <em>representative</em> beat in the record, which for reasons discussed below will <em>never</em> (well, hardly ever) be the first beat.</p>\n\n<p>You can decide for yourself which beats are representative (typical), and you should choose one of them for your measurements. Among the characteristics that define a representative beat is that it should not immediately follow an atypical beat, because an atypical beat may (and usually does) influence the characteristics of the immediately following beat. This would tend to rule out using the first beat in any record, since the preceding beat cannot be examined and it is therefore not possible to say if it was atypical.</p>\n\n<p>If the first beat appears similar to the second beat and to most of the others in the record, and the second beat is clean, then the second beat is an ideal choice for the representative beat.</p>\n\n<p>If, after looking at the entire record, you decide that only the first beat is clean enough to measure, and that it looks typical, then use the first beat if you wish. This is the only situation in which you should consider choosing the first beat in a record, and it is unlikely to be necessary in the Challenge dataset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My software denoises the signals, so I don&#39;t need to choose a clean beat to measure. Does it really matter?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is certainly possible that your denoising may do an excellent job, but keep in mind that for the purposes of the Challenge, your measurements will be compared against those made by other participants, and that there are (real) beat-to-beat variations in QT interval. All other things being equal, your results will be best if you measure the same beat as the majority of other participants, so yes, it does really matter that you try to use the same criteria for choosing this beat as everyone else does!</p>\n\n<p>We specified the <em>first</em> representative beat in the record because even respiration-related interbeat interval variations may be reflected in the QT interval. Our hope is that most participants will choose one of a very small number of possibilities in each record, and that the inter-observer variability will be smaller than would be expected if each participant chose a random representative beat (and a wider variety of respiratory phases were sampled in the pooled data for each record).</p>\n\n<p>We could have left this problem out of the challenge by designating a specific beat to be measured in each record, but the issue of choosing a typical beat to characterize the record is an important aspect of arriving at a reliable method for measuring QT intervals, given current standards of clinical practice. It is certainly debatable whether measuring a QT interval from a single beat should ever be considered a reliable basis for making clinical decisions, but that&#39;s a debate for another time (and maybe another challenge!).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do you allow division 1 participants to measure only half of the database?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We want to encourage as many entries in division 1 as we can, and we expect that some participants will not have the time to measure the entire set of records in the challenge database. The inclusion of the yield (see &quot;How are the scores determined?&quot; above) in the score calculation is intended to give everyone, and especially participants in division 1, an incentive to measure as many records as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why don&#39;t you have a challenge about ...?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each year, we receive many suggestions for challenge topics. We encourage you to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=challenge-topic\"> write to us</a> with further suggestions.</p>\n\n<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>\n\n<p>Special thanks to Hans Koch at PTB Berlin for proposing this Challenge, to his colleague Uwe Steinhoff for valuable discussions at CinC 2005 in Lyon, and to Michael Oeff, Hans Koch, Ralf Bousseljot, and Dieter Kreiseler of PTB Berlin for their generous contribution of the excellent PTB Diagnostic ECG Database used in this Challenge. Thanks also to Uwe Steinhoff and Raphael Schneider for compiling the reading list below.</p>\n\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\n\n<p>During the development of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/other.shtml#csedb\">CSE Database</a>, a &quot;median self-centering approach&quot; was followed to evaluate the performance of different algorithms for measuring ECG waveforms. The methods used in this Challenge for bootstrapping the determination of the reference QT intervals, and of scoring the entries, were inspired by this important and closely related work, which is described in these papers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Willems JL, Arnaud P, van Bemmel JH, Bourdillon PJ, Brohet C, Dalla Volta S, Andersen JD, Degani R, Denis B, Demeester M, et al. <a href=\"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/71/3/523.abstract\">Assessment of the performance of electrocardiographic computer programs with the use of a reference data base</a>.

The best score achieved by a manually reviewed entry was 6.67 ms (raw score: 6.65 ms, yield: 0.998), submitted by Mariano Llamedo Soria of the Universidad Tecnologica Nacional FRBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina. In all, seven entries in division 1 received scores below 20 ms. The best score achieved by an automated method was 16.34 ms (raw score: 15.53 ms, yield: 0.951), submitted by Dieter Hayn of ARC Seibersdorf Research GmbH, Graz, Austria. This entry achieved seventh place overall. The best score achieved by an open source automated method was 17.33 ms (raw score: 17.30 ms, yield: 0.998), by Yuriy Chesnokov of the Unilever Centre for Molecular Science Informatics, Cambridge University. This entry achieved ninth place overall, and second among all automated methods. In all, three entrants in divisions 2 and 3 earned scores below 20 ms, and six more received scores below 30 ms. An unofficial entry formed by combining the results of the three top entries in each of divisions 2 and 3 achieved a score of 10.93 ms (raw score: 10.39 ms, yield 0.951).</p>\n\n<h3>Papers</h3>\n\n<div>\n<p>These papers were presented at <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\"><em>Computers in Cardiology 2006</em></a>.

The goal of the contest is to stimulate effort and advance the state of the art in this clinically significant problem, and to foster both friendly competition and wide-ranging collaborations. We will award prizes of US$500 to the most successful entrant in each of two events.<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/#1\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Data for development and evaluation</h3>\n\n<p>Data for this contest have kindly been provided by Dr. Thomas Penzel of Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany, and are available <a href=\"/content/apnea-ecg/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The data to be used in the contest are divided into a <em>learning set</em> and a <em>test set</em> of equal size. Each set consists of 35 recordings, containing a single ECG signal digitized at 100 Hz with 12-bit resolution, continuously for approximately 8 hours (individual recordings vary in length from slightly less than 7 hours to nearly 10 hours). Each recording includes a set of reference annotations, one for each minute of the recording, that indicate the presence or absence of apnea during that minute. These reference annotations were made by human experts on the basis of simultaneously recorded respiration signals. Note that the reference annotations for the test set will not be made available until the conclusion of the contest. Eight of the recordings in the learning set include three respiration signals (oronasal airflow measured using nasal thermistors, and chest and abdominal respiratory effort measured using inductive plethysmography) each digitized at 20 Hz, and an oxygen saturation signal digitzed at 1 Hz. These additional signals can be used as reference material to understand how the apnea annotations were made, and to study the relationships between the respiration and ECG signals.</p>\n\n<p>The database does not contain episodes of pure central apnea or of Cheyne-Stokes respiration; all apneas in these recordings are either obstructive or mixed. Minutes containing hypopneas (defined as intermittent drops in respiratory flow below 50%, accompanied by drops in oxygen saturation of at least 4%, and followed by compensating hyperventilation) are also scored as minutes containing apnea. Additional information about the recordings was posted <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/apnea-ecg/additional-information.txt\">here</a> after the conclusion of the competition, including (for all recordings) age, gender, height, weight, AI (apnea index), HI (hypopnea index), and AHI (apnea-hypopnea index). The subjects of these recordings are men and women between 27 and 63 years of age, with weights between 53 and 135 kg (BMI between 20.3 and 42.1); AHI ranges from 0 to 93.5 in these recordings.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Sleep apnea definitions</h3>\n\n<p>Several definitions for clinically significant sleep apnea have been in clinical use since 1978, when Guilleminault defined &quot;sleep apnea syndrome&quot; as more than 30 apneas per night. In 1981, Lavie proposed a more selective criterion of 100 apneas per night. Later criteria were based on an &quot;apnea index&quot; (the number of apneas per hour, or the number of minutes containing apnea per hour). Most clinicians regard an apnea index below 5 as normal, and an apnea index of 10 or more as pathologic. In 1988, He et al. found increased mortality in untreated patients with apnea indices of 20 or more, and such patients are now recognized as in need of treatment. Criteria used in current practice rely not only on an apnea index, but also on symptoms and cardiovascular sequelae.<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/#2\"><sup>2</sup></a></p>\n\n<h3>Data classes</h3>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this challenge, based on these varied criteria, we have defined three classes of recordings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Class A (Apnea)</strong>: These meet all criteria. Recordings in class A contain at least one hour with an apnea index of 10 or more, and at least 100 minutes with apnea during the recording. The learning and test sets each contain 20 class A recordings.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Class B (Borderline)</strong>: These meet some but not all of the criteria. Recordings in class B contain at least one hour with an apnea index of 5 or more, and between 5 and 99 minutes with apnea during the recording. The learning and test sets each contain 5 class B recordings.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Class C (Control)</strong>: These meet none of the criteria, and may be considered normal. Recordings in class C contain fewer than 5 minutes with apnea during the recording. The learning and test sets each contain 10 class C recordings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Events and scoring</h3>\n\n<p>Each entrant may compete in one or both of the following events:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Apnea screening</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this event, your task is to design software that can classify the 35 test set recordings into class A (apnea) and class C (control or normal) groups, using the ECG signal to determine if significant sleep apnea is present. Your classifications for the 5 class B (borderline) recordings will not influence your score in this event (but you must classify them into either class A or class C, since you will not know which records belong to class B until the correct classifications of the 35 test set records are disclosed after the end of the contest). Your score for this event is simply the number of correct classifications; thus the maximum score possible is 30.</p>\n\n<p>An example may help to clarify the scoring: A contestant submits her results, classifying 22 recordings in class A and 13 in class C (for a total of 35). Out of the 22 recordings that her software has identified as class A, 16 of them are actually class A, 3 are class B and 3 are class C. Out of the 13 recordings that her software identified as class C, 7 have been correctly identified, and other 6 include 4 class A and 2 class B. The score in this case is 23 (16 correct class A identifications, plus 7 in class C). Class B cases do not contribute to the final score; rather, they provide a buffer zone between the cut of classes A and C.</p>\n\n<p>We have chosen to exclude the class B recordings from the calculation of the scores because the utility of a screening test depends primarily on the accuracy with which it classifies the unambiguous cases, both positive and negative (classes A and C respectively in this instance). If you wish to attempt to classify recordings into all three groups, you may submit a second set of classifications, and we will calculate your score in the same way (but the maximum possible score in this case will be 35). The highest scores obtained in this way will be published, but will not be the basis for an award.</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. Quantitative assessment of apnea</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this event, your software must generate a minute-by-minute annotation file for each recording, in the same format as those provided with the learning set, using the ECG signal to determine when sleep apnea occurs. Your annotations will be compared with a set of reference annotations to determine your score. Each annotation that matches a reference annotation earns one point; thus the highest possible score for this event will be approximately 16800 (480 annotations in each of 35 records). It is important to understand that scores approaching the maximum are very unlikely, since apnea assessment can be very difficult even for human experts. Nevertheless, the scores can be expected to provide a reasonable ranking of the ability of the respective algorithms to mimic the decisions made by human experts.</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Obtaining scores</h3>\n\n<p>A form that will permit you to submit your classifications and/or annotations for scoring is now available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/apnea-ecg/challenge/\">here</a>. You will receive a reference number and your score(s) by return e-mail. You may revise your submissions and try again if you wish, but attempts to exploit this service in order to discover the correct classifications are contrary to the spirit of the contest and will result in disqualification.</p>\n\n<h3>How to enter</h3>\n\n<p>To enter the competition, submit an abstract with a concise description of your approach to the problem to <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu\">Computers in Cardiology 2000</a> no later than Wednesday, 3 May 2000. Your abstract must include your reference number and score(s); for this reason, do not wait until the last minute to submit your classifications and/or annotations for scoring. If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page paper for presentation during the conference and publication in the conference proceedings. We welcome and encourage contributions to PhysioNet of software developed during this competition.</p>\n\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n\n<p>The author(s) of the top-scoring eligible entry in each event will receive an award of US$500 in recognition of his or her achievement. In the event of a tie, the date of the author&#39;s abstract submission will be the tie-breaker. This rule favors early submission of abstracts, but permits authors to improve their results if they can after submitting their abstracts. Classifications or annotations received for scoring after noon GMT on Friday, 22 September 2000 will not be eligible for awards. Submissions from members and affiliates of our research groups at MIT, Boston University, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, McGill University, and Phillips-University are not eligible for awards, although all are welcome to participate.</p>\n\n<h3>Workshop/Panel discussion</h3>\n\n<p>All entrants are invited to describe their methods during a panel discussion at Computers in Cardiology in Boston on Sunday, 24 September 2000, when the awards will be given. Individual presentations of accepted papers will be scheduled for one or more sessions of the conference during the following days (25-27 September).</p>\n\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n\n<p><a>1.</a> Funding for the awards has been contributed by the <a href=\"http://reylab.bidmc.harvard.edu\">Margret and H.A.

The score is the total number of correct classifications of the 20 class A (apnea) and 10 class C (control/no apnea) recordings, so that the maximum possible score is 30. Since four entrants achieved a perfect score, the date of the top-scoring entrant&#39;s submission is the tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<p>The top scores in event 1 are:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Score</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entrant</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Date</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entries</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/m9-3.htm\">MR Jarvis and PP Mitra</a><br>\n\t\t\tCaltech, Pasadena, CA, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-4.htm\">B Raymond, R Cayton, R Bates, and M Chappell</a><br>\n\t\t\tBirmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, UK</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-3.htm\">P de Chazal, C Henehan, E Sheridan, R Reilly, P Nolan, and M O&#39;Malley</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity College - Dublin, Ireland</td>\n\t\t\t<td>17 July</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>30/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-4.htm\">J McNames, A Fraser, and A Rechtsteiner</a><br>\n\t\t\tPortland State University, Portland, OR, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>29/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-5.htm\">PK Stein and PP Domitrovich</a><br>\n\t\t\tWashington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-5.htm\">JE Mietus, C-K Peng, PCh Ivanov, and AL Goldberger</a><br>\n\t\t\tBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA (unofficial entry)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>27 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-6.htm\">Z Shinar, A Baharav, and S Akselrod</a><br>\n\t\t\tTel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel</td>\n\t\t\t<td>29 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-1.htm\">MJ Drinnan, J Allen, P Langley, and A Murray</a><br>\n\t\t\tFreeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-2.htm\">C Maier, M Bauch, and H Dickhaus</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Heidelberg, Heilbronn, Germany</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>28/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-2.htm\">M Schrader, C Zywietz, V von Einem, B Widiger, G Joseph</a><br>\n\t\t\tMedical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany</td>\n\t\t\t<td>7 August</td>\n\t\t\t<td>8</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>27/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s53-3.htm\">C Marchesi, M Paoletti, S Di Gaetano</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Firenze, Firenze, Italy</td>\n\t\t\t<td>28 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>27/30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/s83-1.htm\">M Ballora, L Glass, B Pennycook, PCh Ivanov, and AL Goldberger</a><br>\n\t\t\tMcGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada (unofficial entry)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Each entrant&#39;s best score is shown, along with the date when they achieved that score. Many entrants submitted multiple entries, and the &#39;Entries&#39; shown indicate how many entries were submitted by each entrant up to and including the one that scored highest (later entries, and entries that did not receive scores because of formatting errors were not counted); this gives some sense of how much &#39;tuning&#39; may have taken place. Entries noted as &#39;unofficial&#39; came from two of the PhysioNet core research groups, and were therefore not eligible for awards, although they followed all of the rules of the competition.</p>\n\n<p>Only one entry, from PK Stein, was submitted for an unofficial &#39;three-way score&#39; (the total of correct classifications of all 35 records, including the 5 class B (borderline) records). This is a significantly more difficult task, since the amount of apnea in the class B records must be accurately determined in order to classify them correctly, and recognizing apnea in recordings that have only small amounts of apnea is more difficult than in recordings with frequent apneas. The single entry received a score of 33/35, an excellent result; the only errors occurred when a class A record was put in class B, and a class B record was put in class A.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 2 (Apnea Quantification)</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this event, each minute of each of the 35 recordings in the test set must be classified as containing apnea (A) or not (N).

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>Following the success of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/\">first Computers in Cardiology Challenge</a>, we are pleased to offer a new challenge from PhysioNet and <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology 2001</a>. The challenge is to develop a fully automated method to predict the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF), based on the ECG prior to the event. The goal of the contest is to stimulate effort and advance the state of the art in this clinically significant problem, and to foster both friendly competition and wide-ranging collaborations.</p>\n\n<h3>Data for development and evaluation</h3>\n\n<p>PhysioNet provides free access to a set of data to be used for development and evaluation of algorithms. The <a href=\"/content/afpdb\">PAF Prediction Challenge Database</a> consists of 100 pairs of half-hour ECG recordings. Each pair of recordings is obtained from a single 24-hour ECG. Subjects in group A experienced PAF; for these subjects, one recording ends just before the onset of PAF, and the other recording is distant in time from any PAF (there is no PAF within 45 minutes before or after the excerpt). Subjects in group N do not have PAF; in these, the times of the recordings have been chosen at random.</p>\n\n<p>The database is divided into a <em>learning set</em> and a <em>test set</em> of equal size, each containing approximately equal numbers of subjects from groups A and N. The classifications of the recordings in the learning set are provided; those for the test set will be revealed after the conclusion of the challenge.</p>\n\n<h3>Events and scoring</h3>\n\n<p>We will award prizes of US$500 to the most successful entrant in each of two events:</p>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><strong>Event 1: PAF screening</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Event 1 is intended to determine if subjects in group A can be distinguished from those in group N. (In other words, can individuals at risk of PAF be identified within a larger population, based on their ECGs?) The number of correctly classified subjects (0 to 50) is the event 1 score.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Event 2: PAF prediction</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Event 2 is intended to determine if subjects in group A have distinctive and detectable changes in their ECGs immediately before PAF. (In other words, is the imminent onset of PAF predictable in an individual known to be at risk of PAF?) A successful method for doing so should be able to determine which record of each pair of group A records immediately precedes PAF. If the identities of the group A records were known, it would be sufficient to classify these records only; since the goal of event 1 is to identify group A, however, we have not provided this information! Entrants in event 2 of the challenge must therefore classify exactly one of each pair of records in the test set as `A&#39; (defined as ``immediately preceding PAF, if the patient belongs to group A&#39;&#39;), and the other as `N&#39; (defined as ``not immediately preceding PAF&#39;&#39;). One point is awarded for each correctly classified record pair, so that the event 2 scores range from <em>n</em> to 50 (the lower bound is <em>n</em>, the number of subjects in group N, because the group N subjects are always considered correctly classified).</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>If a tie occurs in either event, the date of the submission is the tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<h3>How to enter</h3>\n\n<p>To enter the competition:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Develop an algorithm for classifying the test set recordings. The algorithm must perform this task unaided (manual and semiautomated methods are not eligible).</li>\n\t<li>Submit your classifications to PhysioNet for scoring (click <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/afpdb/challenge/\">here</a> for detailed instructions).</li>\n\t<li>Submit an abstract with a concise description of your approach and results to <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology 2001</a>. (<strong>Deadline: 1 May 2001</strong>). Please submit your abstract using the category <strong>ECG: Arrhythmia</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page paper for presentation during the conference and publication in the conference proceedings. We welcome and encourage contributions to PhysioNet of software developed during this competition.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to improve your score, you may revise your entry and submit it again for scoring. The number of submissions is limited (you will be allowed six entries, which may be all in one event, or divided between the two events as you wish). If you wish to submit additional entries, the autoscorer will enforce a waiting period, which is 24 hours for the seventh entry and doubles for every subsequent entry.</p>\n\n<p>If you have submitted an abstract to Computers in Cardiology 2001 on or before 1 May 2001, you are eligible for awards based on any scores you receive before the challenge deadline of noon GMT on Friday, 21 September 2001.</p>\n\n<p>If you have not submitted an abstract on or before 1 May, you may still participate in the challenge as an unofficial entrant, but you will not be eligible for an award. If you achieve a high score, it will appear in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/top-scores.shtml\">list of top scores</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Links</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/afpdb/\">PAF Prediction Challenge Database</a>.

The top score and the award in event 1 was obtained by G&uuml;nther Schreier and colleagues of the Austrian Research Centers Seibersdorf (Graz, Austria). In event 2, the top score was obtained by Wei Zong and colleagues at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA); because this entry came from one of the PhysioNet core research groups, however, it was unofficial, and the award in event 2 was given to the team with the highest official score, who were once again G&uuml;nther Schreier and colleagues. We congratulate and thank all of the participants in this challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The immediate goal of the Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2001 was to develop a fully automated method to predict the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF), based on the ECG prior to the event. Entrants developed and tested methods using a database created for this challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The test set of the <a href=\"/content/afpdb/\">PAF Prediction Challenge Database</a> consists of 50 pairs of half-hour ECG recordings. Each pair of recordings is obtained from a single 24-hour ECG. Subjects in group A experienced PAF; for these subjects, one recording ends just before the onset of PAF, and the other recording is distant in time from any PAF (there is no PAF within 45 minutes before or after the excerpt). Subjects in group N do not have PAF; in these, the times of the recordings have been chosen at random. Entrants were told that between 20 and 30 of the 50 subjects belong to each group; the exact size of each group (28 in group A, 22 in group N) was disclosed only after the conclusion of the challenge in September.</p>\n\n<p>Brief descriptions of the methods used can be viewed by following the links in the tables below to abstracts submitted by many of the entrants for presentation at Computers in Cardiology 2001; please note that these abstracts were written no later than May 2001, and do not mention results achieved since then. For details on the CinC Challenge 2001, follow the links at the bottom of this page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 1 (PAF Screening)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Event 1 was intended to determine if subjects in group A can be distinguished from those in group N. (In other words, can individuals at risk of PAF be identified within a larger population, based on their ECGs?) The number of correctly classified subjects (0 to 50) is the event 1 score. The best methods were able to achieve roughly 80% classification accuracy on the test set.</p>\n\n<p>The top scores in event 1 are:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Score</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entrant</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Date</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entries</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>41/50<br>\n\t\t\t82%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-6.htm\">G Schreier, P Kastner, and W Marko</a><br>\n\t\t\tAustrian Research Centers Seibersdorf, Graz, Austria</td>\n\t\t\t<td>17 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>8</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>40/50<br>\n\t\t\t80%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-4.htm\">W Zong and RG Mark</a><br>\n\t\t\tHarvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA (unofficial entry)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>7</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>37/50<br>\n\t\t\t74%</td>\n\t\t\t<td>R Sweeney and colleagues<br>\n\t\t\tGuidant Corp., St. Paul, MN, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>8 May</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>36/50<br>\n\t\t\t72%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-5.htm\">C Maier, M Bauch, and H Dickhaus</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Applied Sciences, Heilbronn, Germany</td>\n\t\t\t<td>19 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>35/50<br>\n\t\t\t70%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-7.htm\">C Marchesi and M Paoletti</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversit&agrave; di Firenze, Firenze, Italy</td>\n\t\t\t<td>27 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>34/50<br>\n\t\t\t68%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/p73-3.htm\">KS Lynn and HD Chiang</a><br>\n\t\t\tCornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>28 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>33/50<br>\n\t\t\t66%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/p73-2.htm\">CC Yang</a><br>\n\t\t\tNational Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan</td>\n\t\t\t<td>21 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>33/50<br>\n\t\t\t66%</td>\n\t\t\t<td>JA Kors<br>\n\t\t\tErasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10 July</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>32/50<br>\n\t\t\t64%</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/s42-2.htm\">P de Chazal and C Heneghan</a><br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia</td>\n\t\t\t<td>13 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>32/50<br>\n\t\t\t64%</td>\n\t\t\t<td>R Loesch</td>\n\t\t\t<td>14 September</td>\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Each entrant&#39;s best score is shown, along with the date when they achieved that score. Many entrants submitted multiple entries, and the &#39;Entries&#39; shown indicate how many entries were submitted by each entrant up to and including the one that scored highest (later entries, and entries that did not receive scores because of formatting errors were not counted); this gives some sense of how much &#39;tuning&#39; may have taken place. The entry noted as &#39;unofficial&#39; came from one of the PhysioNet core research groups, and was therefore not eligible for awards, although the entrant followed all of the rules of the competition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 2 (PAF Prediction)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Event 2 was intended to determine if subjects in group A have distinctive and detectable changes in their ECGs immediately before PAF. (In other words, is the imminent onset of PAF predictable in an individual known to be at risk of PAF?) A successful method for doing so should be able to determine which record of each pair of group A records immediately precedes PAF. If the identities of the group A records were known, it would be sufficient to classify these records only; since the goal of event 1 was to identify group A, however, we did not provide this information! Entrants in event 2 of the challenge therefore were required to classify exactly one of each pair of records in the test set as `A&#39; (defined as ``<em>immediately preceding PAF, if the patient belongs to group A</em>&#39;&#39;), and the other as `N&#39; (defined as ``<em>not immediately preceding PAF</em>&#39;&#39;). One point was awarded for each correctly classified record pair, so that the raw event 2 scores range from <em>22</em> to 50 (the lower bound is <em>22</em>, the number of subjects in group N, because the group N subjects are always considered correctly classified). In the table below, the scores have been adjusted by subtraction of 22 from the raw scores, so that the adjusted scores can range between 0 and 28.</p>\n\n<p>The top scores in event 2

We received many suggestions for challenge topics, and encourage you to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=challenge-topic\"> write to us</a> with further suggestions. We chose the topic for this year&#39;s challenge not only for its intrinsic interest, but also because it is quite different from the previous two challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Heart rate variability has attracted much attention from researchers since the early 1980s. It has long been understood that a metronomic heart rate is pathological, and that the healthy heart is influenced by multiple neural and hormonal inputs that result in variations in interbeat (RR) intervals, at time scales ranging from less than a second to 24 hours. Even after 20 years of study, new analytic techniques continue to reveal properties of the time series of RR intervals. Much research in this area aims to discover or to explain how specific changes in variability can be related to specific pathologies.</p>\n\n<p>Given how much is known about heart rate variability, it might be thought that simulating a realistic sequence of RR intervals would be an easy task. The intricate interdependencies of variations at different scales, however, make it difficult to create a simulation of sufficient realism to mislead an experienced observer, and it may be even harder to deceive a program designed to quantify these subtle features.</p>\n\n<p>Each of the figures below shows a 10 hour time series of RR intervals at the same scale (the range of heart rates is roughly 70 to 120 bpm in each case). Can you identify which of these time series is synthetic? (rr1.png and rr2.png)</p>\n\n<p><br>\nIt may be difficult to identify the synthetic data based on the figures; you may download the RR interval time series in text form for <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/rr1.txt\">series 1</a> and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/rr2.txt\">series 2</a> if you wish to inspect the data in more detail. (Click <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/answer.html\">here</a> for the answer.)</p>\n\n<p>Our challenge is therefore twofold: Can you construct a simulation of the RR interval time series spanning a full 24 hours with sufficient verisimilitude to be taken as real? Can you classify a mixed set of real and simulated RR interval time series? As in previous challenges, we awarded prizes of US$500 to the most successful entrant in each of two events.</p>\n\n<h3>Organization of the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>During the first eight weeks of the challenge, participants in event 1 created software that can generate synthetic RR interval time series. Participants entered event 1 of the challenge by submitting a generator (model) in source form by email (see the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/#rules-1\">rules</a> below). The period for submitting entries for event 1 ended at noon GMT on Monday, 22 April 2002; no late entries can be accepted. We created two synthetic 24-hour RR interval time series using each generator entered into the challenge. We also created a number of additional synthetic series using generators not entered into the challenge.</p>\n\n<p>We have provided an approximately equal number of real 24-hour RR interval time series. These were derived from long-term ECG recordings of adults between the ages of 20 and 50 who have no known cardiac abnormalities, similar to those included in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/nsrdb/\">MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database</a>. These recordings typically begin and end in the early morning (within an hour or two of the subject&#39;s awakening). Small numbers of ectopic beats are common in such recordings, as are short intervals of artifacts that may cause false beat detections or missed beat detections. We have excluded recordings with significant amounts of noise or ectopy.</p>\n\n<p>The synthetic and real series have been assigned random identification numbers in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/dataset/\">challenge dataset</a>, which was posted on PhysioNet on Wednesday, 24 April 2002, marking the start of event 2.</p>\n\n<p>Participants in event 2 have classified each series in the challenge dataset as real, synthetic, or unknown (see the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/#rules-2\">rules</a> below). An <a href=\"https://physionet.org/cgi-bin/cinc-2002-score\">autoscorer</a> received entries submitted using a web browser, and returned scores by email to participants.

The qualified participant whose generator produces the most realistic time series, as defined below, received an award of US$500 (see the challenge results).</p>\n\n<p>To avoid bias, the realism of the series was judged by the challenge participants themselves, in event 2. The most recent set of classifications from each qualified participant in event 2 received by noon GMT on 30 April 2002 was used to score the generators. Participants who have entered more than one generator will receive a separate score for each generator.</p>\n\n<p><em>Update (25 February 2002):</em> The overall accuracy, <em>a</em>, of each event 2 participant (defined as the number of correct classifications made by that participant divided by the number of series to be classified) defines a weight</p>\n\n<p><em>w</em> = (<em>a</em> - 0.5)<sup>2</sup> + 0.05</p>\n\n<p>given to that participant&#39;s classifications. Each generator receives 2<em>w</em> points for each &quot;real&quot; classification if <em>a</em> &gt; 0.5, 2<em>w</em> points for each &quot;synthetic&quot; classification if <em>a</em> &le; 0.5, and <em>w</em> points for each &quot;unknown&quot; classification.</p>\n\n<p>To qualify for an award in event 1, a participant must do all of the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Submit a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/#valid-1\">valid entry for event 1</a> no later than noon GMT on Monday, 22 April 2002.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/event-2.shtml\">valid entry for event 2</a> no later than noon GMT on Tuesday, 30 April 2002.</li>\n\t<li>Submit an abstract describing his or her generator to <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology</a>, no later than Friday, 3 May 2002.</li>\n\t<li>Attend Computers in Cardiology 2002, 22-25 September 2002, in Memphis, Tennessee.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Please note point 2 above!</strong> You <em>must</em> enter event 2 in order to qualify for an award in event 1. This rule was intended to insure that participants in event 1 received feedback on the success of their generators before the CinC abstract deadline.</p>\n\n<p>Each participant was allowed to submit up to five generators, and each was treated as a separate entry. Participants were permitted to replace any of their previous entries with an improved version at any time until noon GMT on Monday, 22 April 2002.</p>\n\n<p>A prize of US$500 will be awarded to the qualified participant whose generator has received the highest score. If a tie had occured, scores for the tying generators only would have been recalculated using all classifications (not only the final classifications) from each qualified participant. If a tie had remained, the date and time of submission would have been the final tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<h3>How to Submit a Valid Entry for Event 1</h3>\n\n<p><strong>The deadline for submitting entries for event 1 has passed, and no more entries can be accepted.</strong> If you have missed the deadline, however, we encourage you to submit your generator anyway. If there is sufficient interest, we will rerun the challenge at a later date.</p>\n\n<p>Begin by downloading <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/rrgen.c\">rrgen.c</a>, which contains an example generator.</p>\n\n<p>You will need to write functions in standard (ANSI/ISO) C to replace the initialize and generate functions in the example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>initialize is called once, before generate is called the first time. Its first argument is a 32-bit (long) integer, which will be given a different random value each time this program is run as part of the challenge. Its second argument specifies the length of the simulation, in seconds.</li>\n\t<li>generate is called once per RR interval. It should return the length of the next (simulated) RR interval in seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the challenge, your generator will be used to generate two series that should be different (otherwise they will be rather easy to recognize as synthesized!). Use the arguments to initialize to set up the initial conditions for your simulation. You might use the first argument as a seed for a random number generator as in the example.</p>\n\n<p>If you prefer, you can do the entire simulation within initialize, saving the results to an array; then generate can return one value from the array each time it is invoked by main. Make sure the array is long enough if you take this approach; you can use the second argument of initialize to help determine the array length.</p>\n\n<p>Although the challenge will be based on 24-hour simulations, make sure that your generator can create longer time series (of at least 48 hours).</p>\n\n<p>You may, if necessary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>define additional functions</li>\n\t<li>define global variables</li>\n\t<li>include other ANSI/ISO C standard header (.h) files</li>\n\t<li>allocate memory as needed using malloc or similar functions</li>\n\t<li>invoke other functions from the ANSI/ISO C standard library and math library</li>\n\t<li>create temporary files in the current directory</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you create temporary files, do so within the current directory only, and use file names beginning with temp. Any files created will be removed between runs (you cannot save information from one run to use in another).</p>\n\n<p>You may not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>modify main</li>\n\t<li>write to the standard output (main does this, but your code may not)</li>\n\t<li>use chdir or any other means to change the current directory</li>\n\t<li>invoke fork, system, or any of the exec family of functions to start another program or another process</li>\n\t<li>incorporate portions of real (physiologic) RR interval sequences in the output</li>\n\t<li>incorporate code or data that cannot be made freely available after the conclusion of the Challenge</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All code will be reviewed before being compiled or run. Please keep your code neat. If we can&#39;t figure out what your program does, we won&#39;t run it!</p>\n\n<p>All code must compile cleanly using:</p>\n\n<pre>             gcc -Wall rrgen.c -lm\n</pre>\n\n<p>There must be no errors or warnings of any kind.</p>\n\n<p>Your program must run to completion within a reasonable time. A reasonable time is 1 minute or less for a 24-hour simulation running on a 1 GHz Athlon under Linux; we will not disqualify programs that slightly exceed this limit. For reference, the example program generates 24 hours of simulated data in roughly 0.2 seconds, so if your program is no more than about 300 times slower than the example, it should be fine.</p>\n\n<p>All programs entered will be posted with full credit to their authors on PhysioNet following the conclusion of the Challenge, and will be made freely available under the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt\">GPL</a> (or another <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/\">open source license</a> if you prefer).</p>\n\n<p>Test your entry before submitting it. Don&#39;t forget to include your name, affiliation, and email address in the comment block at the top of the file. Once you are ready, send a copy of your program (source only; do not send binaries) via email to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=rrgen.c\"> webmaster@physionet.org</a> with a subject line of rrgen.c. Please send the source file as plain text, not as HTML or as a word-processor formatted attachment.</p>\n\n<p>Participants received an email confirmation of their entry once it had been reviewed. If a generator failed to meet any of the requirements for a valid entry, participants were advised that the email would indicate in general terms the nature of the problem (e.g., compilation error), but that they would be responsible for debugging their programs. Several entries that arrived shortly before the deadline had very minor problems, which were corrected by the challenge organizer and returned to their authors for review. Each generator that met all requirements for a valid entry was assigned an entry number, which was indicated in the email confirmation.</p>\n\n<h3>Event 2 - Classification</h3>\n\n<p>Participants in this event attempt to determine which members of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/dataset/\">challenge dataset</a> of RR interval time series are synthesized, and which are real.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will classify each series as real, simulated, or unknown, and will submit their classifications to an autoscorer. Scores will be returned by email. Each correct classification increases the score by 2 points, and each incorrect classification reduces the score by 1 point. The qualified participant who received the highest final score (see below) received an award of US$500. Since a tie occurred, the date and time of submission is the tiebreaker.</p>\n\n<p>To qualify for an award in event 2, a participant must do all of the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Submit a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/event-2.shtml\">valid entry for event 2</a> no later than noon GMT on Tuesday, 30 April 2002.</li>\n\t<li>Attend Computers in Cardiology 2002, 22-25 September 2002, in Memphis, Tennessee.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Participants in event 2 were encouraged but not required to submit an abstract describing their methods of classifying the challenge dataset to Computers in Cardiology 2002, no later than Friday, 3 May 2002.</p>\n\n<p>Participants may submit up to five sets of classifications, but only the final score received by each participant will be used to determine the outcome of this event. (Each submission cancels any previous score; scores are not cumulative.) Invalid submissions are not scored and do not count against the limit of five submissions.</p>\n\n<p>If you have missed the 30 April 2002 deadline for submitting your first set of classifications, we still encourage you to participate unofficially. If you receive a high final score, your achievement will be recognized on this web site. If you are able to attend Computers in Cardiology, you will have an opportunity to discuss your work informally with other participants. <a> </a></p>\n\n<p><a> </a> Instructions for submitting an entry to event 2 can be found <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/event-2.shtml\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Important Dates</h3>\n\n<p>All deadlines are at noon GMT unless otherwise indicated. Late entries will not be accepted.</p>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><strong>Monday, 22 April 2002</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Deadline for submission of generators in event 1.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Wednesday, 24 April 2002</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Event 2 begins when the challenge dataset, consisting of the time series to be classified, is posted.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Tuesday, 30 April 2002</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>To qualify for an award in either event, submit a valid entry in event 2 by noon GMT on this date.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Friday, 3 May 2002</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Deadline for submission of abstracts for Computers in Cardiology 2002.</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Sunday-Wednesday, 22-25 September 2002</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Computers in Cardiology, Memphis, Tennessee</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Must I enter both events in order to participate?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No. Event 1 is optional. Event 2 is required of all participants.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I&#39;ve entered both events. Do my classifications of my own synthesized series count?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, for both events. If your generator is a good one, you may find it difficult to identify its output, however! Attempts to &quot;watermark&quot; your output so that you can identify it will be rejected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does each synthesized series get its own event 1 score?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each series in the challenge dataset gets a partial score that reflects how it was classified. These will be posted at the conclusion of the challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The partial scores of the two series created using each generator are added to obtain the score for that generator. The generators&#39; scores determine the winner of event 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did you change the scoring for event 1?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The weighting factor <em>w</em> was introduced so that a generator gets significantly more credit for misleading a really good classifier than for misleading one whose classifications are no better than random. The values of <em>w</em> are symmetric about <em>a</em> = 0.5 because a classifier who misclassifies everything is clearly able to tell the difference between real and synthesized data despite a fundamental confusion about which is which! We&#39;ve added a small positive bias to <em>w</em> so that even the coin-tossers&#39; contributions will have a (small) effect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the significance of SPS in rrgen.c?</strong></p>\n\n<p>SPS is the sampling frequency (in samples per second), which determines how the RR intervals are quantized. All RR intervals in the real time series have lengths that are exact multiples of (1/SPS) seconds, but these have then been converted to a decimal representation with 3 digits after the decimal point. If SPS is 128, for example, intervals such as 0.992, 1.000, 1.008, 1.016, and 1.023 seconds are possible in the real time series, but intermediate values such as 1.001 or 1.002 do not occur. rrgen&#39;s main function uses SPS in a calculation to ensure that the only RR interval values that appear in the synthesized time series are those that can also occur in the real time series. In most cases, you won&#39;t need to refer to SPS explicitly in your code, but it&#39;s there if you need it.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge dataset may include real series with a variety of sampling frequencies between 120 and 1000 samples per second. The synthesized series in the challenge data set will be produced using generators compiled with a similar variety of SPS values, so that it will not be possible to identify the real series simply by looking at the distribution of &quot;forbidden&quot; RR interval values. (Update 24 April: All of the series use the same sampling frequency, 128 samples per second.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>I&#39;ve already entered event 1 five times, and now I have a better generator. Can I enter it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you have previously received entry numbers for the maximum of five generators, you may enter another generator only if you replace a previously accepted generator. To do this, simply tell us (at the beginning of your new entry) the entry number for the generator you wish to replace (e.g., &quot;This entry should replace entry number 38.&quot;) If your replacement is accepted, it will be assigned a new entry number; otherwise your original entry will remain in the challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There is a limit of 5 trials in event 2, but one can try as many times as one needs, asking friends or using different email addresses. And if there is no limit on the number of trials, since you return immediately the score, one can proceed by trial and error in order to detect what is real and what is not. I wonder if I missed something. </strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are tempted to try submitting many entries in order to learn about the correct classifications, why not play <a href=\"http://www.lizardpoint.com/fun/mastermind/mastmind.html\">Mastermind</a> instead, where such a strategy is rewarded? We will reject obvious attempts to circumvent the spirit of the challenge in this way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How old are the &quot;normal&quot; subjects whose RR interval time series are included in the challenge dataset? Are they active over the 24 hours (e.g., were the recordings taken with an ambulatory monitor) or were they bed-bound (but otherwise healthy)? </strong></p>\n\n<p>The normals are men and women between the ages of 20 and 50, engaged in their usual activities of daily life. Interbeat intervals were obtained using automated analysis (with some manual review and corrections) of ambulatory (Holter) ECG recordings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Could you elaborate on the reference to &quot;manual review and correction&quot; please? I am assuming that the reviewers removed ectopic beats (those with an RR interval &lt;80% or &gt;120% of the previous RR interval) and replaced them with a beat where an expert would have expected one. Should we therefore not worry about generating the odd ectopic beat (or at least removing the odd beat as if an ectopic had occured and an expert/algorithm had removed it without replacing it)? </strong></p>\n\n<p>No, intervals surrounding ectopic beats are not removed or otherwise adjusted in the real time series. The challenge data set includes only series that have very little or no ectopy. Whatever ectopic beats may be present are marked at their times of occurrence, so that you should expect to see (for example) a few short intervals that precede premature atrial or ventricular beats, and long (compensatory) intervals following premature ventricular beats.</p>\n\n<p>The manual review and corrections have been applied to the original ECG recordings, not to the interbeat interval time series. This process typically involves visual inspection of the longest and shortest detected intervals in each case (which tends to reveal not only ectopic beats but also beats that were not detected automatically and detections that were not beats). Ideally, the output of this process includes the times of occurence of each beat, including any ectopic beats. The interbeat interval time series are prepared from these data without further corrections. Update 24 April: Some of the normals have not been manually corrected.</p>\n\n<p>Participants in event 1 should consider these points carefully. You may wish to generate an interbeat interval time series that results from a beat sequence that includes rare isolated ectopic beats and short periods of signal loss.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Results</h3>\n\n<p>This year&#39;s challenge scoring had an unusual twist: scores for event 1 were determined by entries in event 2, and vice versa. The outcome of event 2 was determined very quickly. Rather than continuing both events until 20 September as originally announced, we collected event 2 entries until the deadline for official entrants (noon GMT on 30 April) had passed, and then determined final scores for event 1.</p>\n\n<p>If you did not have a chance to submit an official entry, we encourage you to participate anyway; you can still submit classifications of the challenge dataset and receive an unofficial score. Unofficial event 1 entries are also welcome; if there is sufficient interest, we will run a second round of this challenge, using new RR interval generators and a new dataset.</p>\n\n<p>Winners of each event received awards during September&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology</a> conference, where participants presented their work. The RR interval generators submitted by event 1 participants are available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Brief descriptions of the methods used can be viewed by following the links in the tables below to abstracts submitted by many of the entrants for presentation at Computers in Cardiology 2002.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 1 (generating RR interval series)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The top scorers in event 1 are:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Place</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entry<br>\n\t\t\tnumber</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Entrant</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Score</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-192.c\">192</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/s41-5+6.htm\">DC Lin</a><br>\n\t\t\tRyerson University, Toronto, Canada</td>\n\t\t\t<td>3.452</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-171.c\">171</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/s51-5.htm\">Dragan Gamberger, Ivan Maric, Tomislav Smuc, Gordan Bosanac, Nikola Bogunovic, Goran Krstacic</a><br>\n\t\t\tRudjer Boskovic Institute, Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation, Zagreb, Croatia</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1.494</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-142.c\">142</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/s51-2.htm\">Albert C-C Yang, Cheng-Hsi Chang, SS Hseu, Huey-Wen Yien</a><br>\n\t\t\tTaipei Veterans General Hospital<br>\n\t\t\tSchool of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.689</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-201.c\">201</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/s41-1+s51-1.htm\">PE McSharry, GD Clifford</a><br>\n\t\t\tDept Maths &amp; Dept Engineering, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.497</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>5 (tie)</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-153.c\">153</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>Manojit Roy<br>\n\t\t\tUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.202</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>5 (tie)</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/generators/rrgen-161.c\">161</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td>Miguel A.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>For the fourth annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge, we propose a provocative question of considerable clinical interest:</p>\n\n<blockquote><strong>Is it possible to tell the difference between transient ST changes in the ECG that are due to myocardial ischemia, and those that are not?</strong></blockquote>\n\n<p>For many years, a simple answer (&quot;no&quot;) was considered to be the final word on this question. Myocardial ischemia results from insufficient oxygen delivery to the myocardium. To diagnose myocardial ischemia definitively, it is necessary to document that blood flow, blood oxygen saturation, or both have been compromised to an extent that the oxygen demands of the myocardium are not satisfied. These diagnostic criteria are typically established by imaging the coronary arteries. Since the ECG does not contain direct information about blood flow or oxygen saturation, it cannot be used to diagnose ischemia.</p>\n\n<p>It may be possible, however, to establish inferential associations between specific features of the ECG and myocardial ischemia. One such association, between transient ischemia and changes in the ST segment of the ECG, is very widely known, and is understood to be highly sensitive, but not specific. It has long been known that repolarization of ischemic myocardial regions is abnormal, that these abnormalities are visible in the ST segment, and that they can be quantified by measuring the deviation of certain portions of the ST segment from baseline measurements. It is also known that deviations in these ST segment measurements can result from a wide variety of other causes, including changes in heart rate, conduction pattern, position of the subject, and noise in the ECG. As a result, observations of transient ST changes are considered suggestive of ischemia but are not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis, absent conclusive evidence from imaging studies.</p>\n\n<p>Even in subjects who are known to have myocardial ischemia, ST changes are not considered a basis for definitive diagnosis of individual episodes of ischemia. In a subject with an old myocardial infarction, for example, the infarct may result in an ST segment with a persistent abnormal pattern (in the frame of reference of the heart). This fixed pattern appears to change with the subject&#39;s body position (upright, supine, etc.) because of movement of the ECG elecrodes relative to the heart. Thus many of those subjects who are most likely to experience ischemia are also among those most likely to have non-ischemic ST changes.</p>\n\n<p>Therapeutic intervention to reduce or eliminate transient ischemic episodes can make a significant difference in quality of life for affected subjects, and may reduce mortality and morbidity in this population. Assessment of the effectiveness of therapy is substantially hindered by the lack of a reliable way of identifying ischemic episodes during activities of daily living, in which imaging studies are not possible. If it were possible to distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic ST changes in ambulatory ECG recordings made during subjects&#39; normal activities, the benefits would be immediate and substantial, in terms of a reduction in the time needed to determine and validate effective therapies, hence in the risk and pain experienced by the affected subjects.</p>\n\n<p>This year&#39;s challenge topic encourages participants to develop novel approaches to analysis of transient ST changes using the recently-completed <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/\">Long-Term ST Database</a>, a meticulously annotated collection of 86 recordings of 2- and 3-lead long-term (20-24 hour) ECGs. Each ST change that meets criteria of clinical significance has been carefully studied by a team of expert annotators, who have drawn upon all available evidence to determine which of these events are consistent with a diagnosis of myocardial ischemia, and which are consistent with other causes. Half of these 86 recordings have been contributed to PhysioNet and are available to participants as a learning set. The remaining recordings form the test set.</p>\n\n<p>Participants are challenged to design and implement algorithms that can closely mimic the decisions made by the expert annotators, classifying the ST changes (events) in the test set as ischemic or non-ischemic. The algorithms are not required to detect the events, but only to classify each given event as ischemic, non-ischemic, or indeterminate.</p>\n\n<h3>Organization of the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>As noted above, the data used for this challenge come from the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/\">Long-Term ST Database</a>. The learning set consists of the 43 records available from PhysioNet. Participants should train their algorithms using these records. The test set consists of the other 43 records.</p>\n\n<p>To enter the challenge, participants will submit their classifiers by email to PhysioNet, where the entries will be compiled and used to classify the ST events in the test set. Each algorithm will receive a score determined by the number of correctly classified events, less the number of incorrectly classified events (those left unclassified will not affect the score). Scores will be returned to participants by email, and high scores will be posted on PhysioNet and updated throughout the challenge period. Participants may revise and resubmit their entries until the challenge deadline of noon GMT on Friday, 12 September 2003.</p>\n\n<p>All participants are encouraged to submit an abstract to Computers in Cardiology 2003 describing their approach to the challenge. (When submitting your abstract, choose the topic &quot;Computers in Cardiology Challenge&quot;.) Abstracts are due on Thursday, 1 May 2003 (note: this deadline has been extended to Thursday, 8 May 2003); details are available on the <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology web site</a>. If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page manuscript (due on Tuesday, 23 September 2003) for publication in the conference proceedings, and you will have the opportunity to discuss your work at the conference. To be eligible for an award, you must submit an abstract and attend the conference.</p>\n\n<p>The eligible participant whose algorithm receives the highest score will receive an award of US$1000, to be presented at <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology 2003</a> (in Thessaloniki, Greece, 21-24 September 2003). A selection of the classifiers will be posted on PhysioNet following the conference.</p>\n\n<h3>Developing an entry</h3>\n\n<p>Use the learning set to develop criteria for classifying the ST events. We recommend that you begin by copying a set of input files for one record of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/\">learning set</a> into an empty local directory. The files that your program will be permitted to read are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the header (.hea) and signal (.dat) files, permitting access to the digitized ECG signals;</li>\n\t<li>the beat annotation (.atr) and ST measurement (.16a) files, providing QRS times of occurrence for each beat, and continuously updated ST-segment measurements based on 16-beat moving averages;</li>\n\t<li>the .stf file, containing the ST level, reference, and deviation for each input signal, at two-second intervals throughout the recording</li>\n\t<li>the .klt file (decompressed from the .klt.zip files available on-line), containing time series of ST and QRS principal components</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, your program will need to have a copy of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2003/epi-files/\">.epi</a> file for the record. These text files have been prepared for this Challenge from the .stb reference annotation files of the Long-Term ST Database; they contain the times of significant ST changes, but not the classifications of those events. Your program is not expected to detect the events, but to classify them, so this file is available to substitute for an ST change detector.</p>\n\n<p>Your program may use any or all of these files as a basis for classifying the ST events. In principle, all of the other files are derivable from the signal (.dat) file, but you are not expected to do so! The other files are provided for use as shortcuts to a solution of the challenge problem; in a clinical application, it would be necessary to integrate the code needed to detect and classify the QRS complexes, measure the ST deviations, and detect the ST events.</p>\n\n<p>For example, to work with record s30701 of the learning set, download</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.hea\">s30701.hea</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.dat\">s30701.dat</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.atr\">s30701.atr</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.16a\">s30701.16a</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.stf\">s30701.stf</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/s30701.klt.zip\">s30701.klt.zip</a> (decompress this using unzip, pkzip, winzip or a similar utility)</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2003/epi-files/s30701.epi\">s30701.epi</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last of these files, s30701.epi, is derived from s30701.stb; it contains:</p>\n\n<pre>  1 40125 2 ?\n  2 40129 1 ?\n  3 64361 0 ?\n  4 64361 1 ?\n  5 76639 2 ?\n  6 76647 1 ?\n  7 77171 2 ?\n  8 77551 2 ?\n  9 79967 1 ?\n 10 79975 2 ?\n</pre>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each line contains information about one event. From left to right, the columns contain an event ID number, the time of the event (the elapsed time from the beginning of the record, in seconds), the signal number (0, 1, or 2) of the affected ECG signal, and the classification of the event, where &#39;?&#39; means &#39;indeterminate&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of each run, your program must have copied the .epi file into a .epo file, replacing the &#39;?&#39; placeholders with its classifications. Use &#39;I&#39; to mark ischemic and &#39;N&#39; to mark non-ischemic events; you may leave indeterminate events marked with &#39;?&#39;. For example, the correct classifications for record s30701 are:</p>\n\n<pre>  1 40125 2 N\n  2 40129 1 N\n  3 64361 0 N\n  4 64361 1 N\n  5 76639 2 I\n  6 76647 1 I\n  7 77171 2 I\n  8 77551 2 I\n  9 79967 1 I\n 10 79975 2 I\n</pre>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thus, the first four ST changes in this example are non-ischemic (in s30701.sta, the expert annotators have marked them as due to axis shift), and the remaining six are consistent with ischemia.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>Your program&#39;s score will be determined by comparing the output .epo files with a set of reference .epr files. The .epr files are identical to the .epi files, except that the classification of each ST event, based on the .stb annotations, is included in place of the &#39;?&#39; markers. A point is added to your score for each match (I/I or N/N), and a point is deducted for each mismatch (I/N or N/I). ST events left unclassified (&#39;?&#39;) do not affect your score. (A set of .epr files for the learning set is available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2003/epr-files/\">here</a> for use while you are developing your classifier. The .epr files for the test set are not available; don&#39;t ask!)</p>\n\n<p>The number of events per record varies considerably, from fewer than ten to several hundred. To avoid giving undue weight in the score to the handful of records that have a majority of the events, the .epr files for the test set contain no more than 20 events each (which have been chosen at random from all of the events in those records with more than 20 annotated events). Only these events will be used as the basis for scoring the entries; the others will not be counted. The same set of .epr files will be used to score all entries.</p>\n\n<h3>How to Enter</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Begin by downloading <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2003/stclass.c\">stclass.c</a> (to be used unmodified) and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2003/analyze.c\">analyze.c</a> (to be used as a template for your entry).</li>\n\t<li>You will need to write functions in standard (ANSI/ISO) C to replace the initialize, analyze, and finalize functions in analyze.c:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>initialize is called once, before analyze is called the first time, and before any of the input files have been opened. Use this function to set up any variables needed by your classifier.</li>\n\t\t<li>analyze is called once per ST event. Its inputs are an event ID number, which starts at 1 for the first ST event in each record and is incremented by 1 for each subsequent event; the time of the event (elapsed time in seconds); and the signal number (0, 1, or 2) of the affected signal. In each run, all of the ST changes identified by the expert annotators within a single record will be presented to the analyze function in time order.</li>\n\t\t<li>finalize is called once, after all of the input files been closed. Your algorithm&#39;s classifications are recorded immediately after finalize exits.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Use label (defined in stclass.c) to record your classifications.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>label accepts two input arguments. The first is an event ID number, and the second is the label you wish to assign to that event (&#39;I&#39;, &#39;N&#39;, or &#39;?&#39;). You can invoke label to mark any of the events at any time (so, for example, you can invoke label from your analyze function if you wish to label the events one at a time, or you can invoke label once per event from your finalize function after accumulating information about all of the events. Your algorithm can relabel any event by invoking label a second (or third, ...) time with the same event ID. Any events that you do not label are marked as &#39;?&#39;.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>You may, if necessary:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>define additional functions</li>\n\t\t<li>define global variables</li>\n\t\t<li>include other ANSI/ISO C standard header (.h) files</li>\n\t\t<li>allocate memory as needed using malloc or similar functions</li>\n\t\t<li>invoke other functions from the ANSI/ISO C standard library and math library, and from the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB library</a></li>\n\t\t<li>write to the standard output or the standard error output (for debugging purposes)</li>\n\t\t<li>create temporary files in the current directory</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<p>If you create temporary files, do so within the current directory only, and use file names beginning with temp. Any files created will be removed between runs (you cannot save information from one run to use in another).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>You may not:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>modify main or any other part of stclass.c</li>\n\t\t<li>use chdir or any other means to change the current directory</li>\n\t\t<li>invoke fork, system, or any of the exec family of functions to start another program or another process</li>\n\t\t<li>incorporate code or data that cannot be made freely available after the conclusion of the Challenge</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>All code will be reviewed before being compiled or run. Please keep your code neat. If we can&#39;t figure out what your program does, we won&#39;t run it!</li>\n\t<li>All code must compile cleanly using:\n\t<pre>             gcc -Wall stclass.c -lm -lwfdb\n</pre>\n\tThere must be no errors or warnings of any kind. See the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB Software Package</a> for information about the WFDB library.\n\n\t<p>If your program does not make use of the .dat, .atr or .16a files, it can be compiled without the WFDB library using:</p>\n\n\t<pre>\t     gcc -Wall -DNOWFDB stclass.c -lm\n</pre>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Your program must run to completion within a reasonable time. A reasonable time is 5 minutes or less for a 24-hour record running on a 1 GHz Athlon under Linux; we will not disqualify programs that slightly exceed this limit.</li>\n\t<li>Test your entry before submitting it. Don&#39;t forget to include your name, affiliation, and email address in the comment block at the top of analyze.c. Once you are ready, send a copy of your version of analyze.c (source only; do not send binaries) via email to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=analyze.c\"> webmaster@physionet.org</a> with a subject line of analyze.c. Please send analyze.c as plain text, not as HTML or as a word-processor formatted attachment.</li>\n\t<li>You will receive an email confirmation of your entry once it has been reviewed. If an entry fails to meet any of the requirements for a valid entry, the email will indicate in general terms the nature of the problem (e.g., compilation error), but you are responsible for debugging your entry. Each valid entry will be assigned an entry number, which will be indicated in the email confirmation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once your entry has been given a number, we will run it on the test set and you will receive a score by return email. The top scores will be posted on PhysioNet and will be updated as new entries arrive. You may revise and resubmit your entry if you wish; note, however, that the challenge organizers will give priority to new participants, so that there may be a delay in receiving scores for revised entries.</p>\n\n<p>We will continue to accept entries until noon GMT on Friday, 12 September 2003. All valid entries submitted before this deadline will be scored.</p>\n\n<p>At Computers in Cardiology 2003 (in Thessaloniki, Greece, 21-24 September 2003), a prize of US$1000 will be awarded to the top-scoring eligible participant.

    "abstract": "<p>The fifth annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge focusses on this question<strong>: </strong>Is it possible to predict if (or when) an episode of atrial fibrillation will end spontaneously?</p>",
    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>The fifth annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge focuses on this question:</p>\n\n<blockquote><strong>Is it possible to predict if (or when) an episode of atrial fibrillation will end spontaneously? </strong></blockquote>\n\n<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common serious cardiac arrhythmia, affecting more than two million people in the US alone. Unlike venticular fibrillation, which is invariably fatal if it is not interrupted, it is possible for atrial fibrillation to be sustained indefinitely, since the ventricles continue to perform the essential function of driving the circulation, albeit inefficiently. The risks of sustained atrial fibrillation are nevertheless serious, and include strokes and myocardial infarctions caused by the formation of blood clots within stagnant volumes in the atria. Evidence suggests that spontaneously terminating (paroxysmal) atrial fibrillation, or PAF, is a precursor to the development of sustained AF.</p>\n\n<p>Although spontaneously terminating episodes of AF are often very short (perhaps a few seconds in duration), it is interesting to note that longer episodes lasting several minutes also occur. These appear to be very similar to sustained (non-terminating) AF. Subtle changes in rhythm during the final minutes or seconds of such episodes may lead to (or predict) termination of AF. Improved understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous termination of atrial fibrillation may lead to improvements in treatment of sustained AF. If it were possible to recognize the conditions under which PAF is likely to self-terminate, it might also be possible to intervene in affected individuals to increase the likelihood of self-termination of what would otherwise be sustained AF.</p>\n\n<h3>Organization of the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>The fifth in our annual series of challenges was announced on 23 September 2003 at Computers in Cardiology in Chalkidiki, Greece. At that time, we posted a collection of 80 digitized ECG recordings, the <a href=\"/content/aftdb/\">AF Termination Challenge Database</a>, containing labelled training data and unlabelled test data, to support this challenge. To enter the challenge, you will need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>develop methods to classify the unlabelled test data</li>\n\t<li>send your classifications to PhysioNet for scoring no later than Saturday, 1 May 2004 at noon GMT</li>\n\t<li>send an abstract describing your methods and discussing your findings to Computers in Cardiology no later than 7 May 2004</li>\n\t<li>(optionally) send up to 4 revised entries per event (see below), no later than Tuesday, 14 September 2004 at noon GMT</li>\n\t<li>(optionally) submit the source code for your classifier, no later than Wednesday, 15 September 2004 at noon GMT.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Details are below.</p>\n\n<p>If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page manuscript (due on Tuesday, 21 September 2004) for publication in the conference proceedings, and you will have the opportunity to discuss your work at the conference. To be eligible for an award, you must submit an abstract and attend the conference.</p>\n\n<p>We invite you to submit the source code for your classifier for possible posting on PhysioNet. One of PhysioNet&#39;s major goals is to foster the creation and free dissemination of high-quality software for research on clinically and scientifically interesting subjects. Software contributed in the course of previous challenges has stimulated new collaborations among its authors, and offers rare opportunities to compare the strengths of varied approaches objectively. We will select well-constructed submissions and will post them with full credit to their authors on PhysioNet. We encourage you to participate in this activity as part of the challenge, and we offer additional awards to the authors of the most successful algorithms submitted. A selection of these algorithms will be posted on PhysioNet following the conference.</p>\n\n<p>As in most of our previous challenges, there are two events, and you are welcome to participate in either or both of them. Up to four awards of US$250 will be presented during a plenary session of Computers in Cardiology in September. The top-scoring particpant in each event will receive an award of US$250, and the top-scoring participant among those who have submitted the source code for their classifiers in each event will receive an award of US$250. Qualified participants may receive more than one award.</p>\n\n<p>Although your initial classifications are due by 1 May 2004, you may attempt to improve your results by submitting a limited number of revised entries, until the final deadline of Wednesday, 15 September 2004. The participants who have achieved the best scores on or before the deadline are the winners of each event.</p>\n\n<h3>The challenge database</h3>\n\n<p>The 80 recordings in the AF Termination Challenge Database are each one minute in length (excerpted from longer recordings),and each contains two simultaneously recorded ECG signals. The cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation in each case. QRS annotations produced by an automated detector are included for the convenience of those who may wish to study the interbeat interval time series rather than (or in addition to) the ECG signals themselves; note, however, that these annotation sets are unaudited and contain small numbers of errors. Each of the 80 records belongs to one of three groups:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Group N</strong>: non-terminating AF (defined as AF that was not observed to have terminated for the duration of the long-term recording, at least an hour following the segment).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Group S</strong>: AF that terminates one minute after the end of the record.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Group T</strong>: AF that terminates immediately (within one second) after the end of the record.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These groups are distributed across a <a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/aftdb/learning-set/\"> learning set</a> (consisting of 10 labelled records from each group) and two test sets. <a>Test set A</a> contains 30 records, of which about one-half are from group N, and of which the remainder are from group T. <a>Test set B</a> contains 20 records, 10 from each of groups S and T. The challenge is to identify the group to which each of the test set records belongs.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>&nbsp;</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Group N</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Group S</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Group T</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Learning set</th>\n\t\t\t<td>n01, n02, ... n10</td>\n\t\t\t<td>s01, s02, ... s10</td>\n\t\t\t<td>t01, t02, ... t10</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Test set A</th>\n\t\t\t<td>about 15 records</td>\n\t\t\t<td>-</td>\n\t\t\t<td>about 15 records</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Test set B</th>\n\t\t\t<td>-</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10 records</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10 records</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>How to enter</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Develop an algorithm for classifying the recordings in test set A or B (or both).

Don&#39;t submit HTML documents, MS Word .doc files, or anything else except plain text; the autoscorer won&#39;t like it!</p>\n\n<p>Valid entries must also include a classification for each record in the event that you are entering. There are 30 records in test set A (event 1) and 20 in test set B (event 2). Incomplete entries are rejected.</p>\n\n<p>For each event, you may submit up to five valid entries; any further entries in that event are invalid and will be rejected. Only your top-scoring entry in each event determines your standing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But I can get five more entries using my friend&#39;s email address!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The autoscorer won&#39;t recognize that ... but the challenge organizers will. Please respect the spirit of the challenge. As we have advised in previous challenges, if you are tempted to submit many entries in order to discover the correct classifications, try playing <a href=\"http://www.lizardpoint.com/fun/mastermind/mastmind.html\">Mastermind</a> instead!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are the scores determined?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The score is the number of correct classifications (so a higher score is always better). The maximum possible scores are 30 for event 1 and 20 for event 2. If there is a tie in any event, the award will go to the first participant to submit a top-scoring entry in that event.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Several records appear to include segments that do not appear to be AF. Is there really AF throughout?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The segments were chosen very carefully and with reference to the entire 24-hour recordings from which they were extracted. In a few cases, there are segments with the appearance of low atrial ectopic rhythm that are in fact AF; this appears to be the case in s09 and t09 (from the learning set). Records a24 (from test set A) and b06 (from test set B) begin with sinus rhythm. Record b09 (in test set B) does not contain sinus rhythm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I enter the challenge using a semi-automated method?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You are welcome to participate unofficially (by submitting results for scoring and by submitting an abstract to Computers in Cardiology), but semi-automated methods are not eligible for awards. Please <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=semiautomated\">send a brief note</a> to let us know what you are doing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why don&#39;t you have a challenge about ...?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each year, we receive many suggestions for challenge topics. We encourage you to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=challenge-topic\"> write to us</a> with further suggestions.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Results</h3>\n\n<p>Over twenty teams participated in this year&#39;s Challenge, on the topic of predicting if (or when) an episode of atrial fibrillation will self-terminate.</p>\n\n<p>During September&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology</a> conference, we presented four awards to eligible participants in this year&#39;s challenge. In each event, an overall best award went to the top-scoring team, and a &quot;best open source&quot; award went to the top-scoring team among those who contributed the source code for their entries. The overall award in event 1 was presented to Dieter Hayn and his colleagues, and the overall award in event 2, as well as the &quot;best open source&quot; awards in both events, were won by Federico Cantini and his colleagues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>challenge-2004.jpg</strong> shows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Left to right: Steve Swiryn, George Moody, Simona Petrutiu, Federico Cantini, Dieter Hayn.</blockquote>\n\n<p>We wish to thank all those who participated in the challenge and in the lively and illuminating discussions during the scientific sessions of Computers in Cardiology.

    "abstract": "<p>The seventh annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge addresses a question of high clinical interest:<strong> </strong>Can the QT interval be measured by fully automated methods with an accuracy acceptable for clinical evaluations?</p>",
    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>The seventh annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge addresses a question of high clinical interest:</p>\n\n<blockquote><strong>Can the QT interval be measured by fully automated methods with an accuracy acceptable for clinical evaluations? </strong></blockquote>\n\n<p>The Expert Working Group (Efficacy) of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) has developed and has given its final (&quot;step 4&quot;) endorsement in May, 2005 to a set of guidelines (ICH E14) for clinical evaluation of QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for non-antiarrhythmic drugs. Quoting from that document:</p>\n\n<blockquote>An undesirable property of some non-antiarrhythmic drugs is their ability to delay cardiac repolarization, an effect that can be measured as prolongation of the QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). The QT interval represents the duration of ventricular depolarization and subsequent repolarization, and is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. A delay in cardiac repolarization creates an electrophysiological environment that favors the development of cardiac arrhythmias, most clearly torsade de pointes (TdP), but possibly other ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well. TdP is a polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia that appears on the ECG as continuous twisting of the vector of the QRS complex around the isoelectric baseline. A feature of TdP is pronounced prolongation of the QT interval in the supraventricular beat preceding the arrhythmia. TdP can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, leading to sudden death.\n<p>While the degree of QT prolongation is recognized as an imperfect biomarker for proarrhythmic risk, in general there is a qualitative relationship between QT prolongation and the risk of TdP, especially for drugs that cause substantial prolongation of the QT interval. Because of its inverse relationship to heart rate, the measured QT interval is routinely corrected by means of various formulae to a less heart rate dependent value known as the QTc interval. It is not clear, however, whether arrhythmia development is more closely related to an increase in the absolute QT interval or QTc. Most drugs that have caused TdP clearly increase both the absolute QT and the QTc (hereafter called QT/QTc). Documented cases of TdP (fatal and non-fatal) associated with the use of a drug have resulted in the withdrawal from the market of several drugs and relegation of other drugs to second-line status. Because prolongation of the QT/QTc interval is the ECG finding associated with the increased susceptibility to these arrhythmias, an adequate pre-marketing investigation of the safety of a new pharmaceutical agent should include rigorous characterization of its effects on the QT/QTc interval.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On first consideration, QT interval measurement in the ECG might seem a rather worked-out problem. In comparison with manual methods, automated methods offer advantages in terms of absolute repeatability of measurements, immunity from errors related to observer fatigue, lapses of attention, and transcription, as well as efficiency and cost considerations that permit either more extensive and rigorous testing for the same cost as manual methods, or more rapid testing at lower cost. An extensive literature documents a wide variety of approaches to the problem.</p>\n\n<p>This topic has acquired renewed importance, however, as regulatory agencies worldwide are moving toward requiring &quot;thorough QT/QTc studies&quot; (as defined in the ICH E14 guidelines) as part of clinical trials for all newly developed drugs. ICH E14 guidelines have been adopted and published by the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/6922fnl.pdf\">US FDA</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.emea.eu.int/pdfs/human/ich/000204en.pdf\">EU&#39;s European Medicines Agency</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nihs.go.jp/dig/ich/efficacy/e14/e14_040610_e.pdf\">Japan&#39;s National Institute of Health Services</a>. Among much else, the guidelines endorse manual QT interval measurement for &quot;thorough QT/QTc studies&quot;, and cite the need for further research before the use of fully automated methods can be accepted in these studies:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Several methods for measuring ECG intervals have been used in clinical trials, and for a given trial, the sponsor should describe the accuracy and precision of QT/QTc interval measurements using the selected system. The method chosen will depend on the level of precision appropriate for a given trial. For example, the &quot;thorough QT/QTc study&quot; would warrant particularly careful attention to interval measurement. At present, this would usually involve the measurement by a few skilled readers (whether or not assisted by computer) operating from a centralized ECG laboratory. <em>If well-characterized data validating the use of fully-automated technologies become available, the recommendations in the guidance for the measurement of ECG intervals could be modified.</em> [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus it is clear from the text of the ICH E14 guidelines that regulatory agencies are currently unconvinced of the reliability of automatic QT interval measurements. A major part of the motivation for this year&#39;s challenge is to provide well-characterized data that might support modifications of the ICH E14 recommendations with respect to fully-automated methods.</p>\n\n<p>Independent of these considerations, the QT interval measurements obtained as a product of this Challenge will support further research aimed at designing robust measures of repolarization characteristics. The difficulty of making accurate measurements of QT intervals on individual beats is a hindrance to studies of variability of repolarization (for example, in exercise). By creating a collection of reference QT intervals that have been measured by many expert observers and automated methods, the Challenge can be a starting point for future studies of alternative measurements that may be possible to derive reliably even when QT intervals cannot be determined directly.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Overview</h3>\n\n<p>The Challenge will include separate divisions (and awards) for participants using manual and semi-automated methods (division 1), and fully automated methods (divisions 2 and 3). By doing so, we aim to establish a firm basis for assessing the accuracy and reliability of fully automatic methods for QT interval measurement, as compared to the manual and semi-automated methods currently endorsed by the ICH E14 guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>One of PhysioNet&#39;s major goals is to foster the creation and free dissemination of high-quality open-source software for research on clinically and scientifically interesting subjects. Software contributed in the course of previous Challenges has stimulated new collaborations among its authors, and offers rare opportunities to compare the strengths of varied approaches objectively. Authors of fully automated algorithms may enter division 3 (the &quot;open source&quot; division) by submitting their source code. We encourage participation in this activity as part of the Challenge, and we offer an additional award to the author(s) of the most successful algorithm submitted in source form. We will select well-constructed submissions and will post them with full credit to their authors on PhysioNet following the conclusion of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>As in our previous Challenges, the data needed by participants can be found on PhysioNet. Participants will select a representative beat from each record in the <a href=\"#database\">challenge database</a> and will measure the times of the PQ junction (the Q-wave onset) and the end of the T-wave for that beat, from which the QT interval for that record will be derived by subtraction. Participants will submit entries containing their PQ and T-end measurements to PhysioNet for <a href=\"#scoring\">scoring</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, 20 September 2006, during a plenary session of <a href=\"http://www.cinc2006.upv.es/index.html\">Computers in Cardiology 2006</a> in Valencia, Spain, we will present four <a href=\"#awards\">awards</a> of US$250 each: for the best (lowest) final score overall, and for the best final scores in division 1, divisions 2 and 3, and division 3. <a href=\"#eligible-participants\">Eligible participants</a> may receive more than one award.</p>\n\n<p>Following the conclusion of the challenge, the final sets of reference QT intervals, together with the entire set of submitted PQ and T-end measurements, will be made available on PhysioNet. Among the questions that may be answerable using this set of measurements are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Which records, if any, exhibit clinically significant differences between the medians of the fully automated measurements and those of the manual or semi-automated measurements? (These records would warrant special attention, because they have features likely to confuse either algorithms or humans.)</li>\n\t<li>Which records, if any, exhibit clinically significant differences between the minimum and maximum manually-measured QT intervals? (These would be of interest for the same reason as the previous group; in addition, the incidence of such records would be of interest in establishing the reliability of manual measurements.)</li>\n\t<li>Are there identifiable subsets of the records that are particularly well-measured, or particularly troublesome, for specific algorithms? (These could be valuable in developing an algorithm that incorporates multiple approaches to provide increased accuracy or reliability.)</li>\n\t<li>Do specific algorithms exhibit systematic bias (consistently over- or underestimating QT intervals)? Such a finding might point the way to trivial algorithm changes that might improve accuracy.</li>\n\t<li>Are there clinically significant differences between manual, semi-automated, and fully automated measurements of QT intervals? We hope to show that (at least for a subset of fully automated measurement algorithms) no such differences exist.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Challenge Database</h3>\n\n<p>The data to be used for this year&#39;s challenge are the 549 recordings of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ptbdb/\">PTB Diagnostic ECG Database</a>, which was contributed to PhysioNet in September 2004 by its creators (Michael Oeff, Hans Koch, Ralf Bousseljot, and Dieter Kreiseler of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Berlin). Each of these recordings contains 15 simultaneously recorded signals: the conventional 12 leads and the 3 Frank (XYZ) leads. Each of these is digitized at 1000 samples per second, with 16 bit resolution over a range of &plusmn;16.384 mV. The records come from 294 subjects (each represented by one to five records) with a broad range of ages and diagnoses. About 20% of the subjects are healthy controls. A detailed clinical summary accompanies each record. The records are typically about two minutes in length, with a small number of shorter records (none less than 30 seconds).</p>\n\n<h3>To Participare in the Challenge, You Will Need To</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>develop methods (which may be fully automated, semi-automated, or manual) to locate the PQ junction (the onset of the Q-wave) and the T-wave end of a representative beat in a 12-lead ECG</li>\n\t<li>apply your methods to obtain the times of occurrence of the PQ junction and T-wave end of the first representative beat in each recording in the challenge database</li>\n\t<li>follow the instructions on the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/template.txt\">entry form</a> to submit your results to PhysioNet for scoring</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To make your measurements of each record, choose the first beat that you consider to be representative (not ectopic, and free of significant noise, artifact, and baseline wander in lead II). In lead II, measure to the nearest millisecond the times of the PQ junction (Q-wave onset) and T-wave end, and record these times (i.e., the elapsed times in milliseconds from the beginning of the record) in your <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/template.txt\">entry form</a>. <strong>An illustrated example of this procedure is available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/example.html\">here</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<h3>To be Eligible for an Award, You Will Also Need To</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>submit at least one <a href=\"#eligible-entry\">eligible entry</a> (due Monday, 24 April 2006 at noon GMT)</li>\n\t<li>submit an <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/Submit.htm\">abstract</a> (due Monday, 1 May 2006, and required only for divisions 2 and 3), describing your methods and discussing your findings, to Computers in Cardiology 2006</li>\n\t<li>submit your <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge%202006%20entry%20source\">source</a> code (due Friday, 8 September 2006, and required only for division 3)</li>\n\t<li>submit a four-page <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu/2006/\">manuscript</a> (due Wednesday, 20 September 2006, if your abstract is accepted) for publication in the conference proceedings</li>\n\t<li>attend <a href=\"http://www.cinc2006.upv.es/index.html\">Computers in Cardiology 2006</a>, to be held 17-20 September 2006 in Valencia, Spain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Eligible Entries</strong></p>\n\n<p>Eligible entries must be in plain text format, in the format of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/template.txt\">template</a>. Don&#39;t submit HTML documents, MS Word .doc files, spreadsheets, or anything else except plain text. Be sure to fill in your name, email, and the Challenge division (1, 2, or 3) at the top of the form in the indicated spaces. Follow the instructions on the form to submit your entry.</p>\n\n<p>You may elect to omit measurements for some records. If your automated methods determine that a particular record cannot be measured reliably, omitting measurements for that record may be preferable to supplying unreliable measurements. If your measurements are made manually or semi-automatically, you need not measure all of the records, although it will be to your advantage to measure as many as possible, because of the way the scores are calculated. Entries in division 1 must include measurements for at least 50% (275) of the 549 records in order to be eligible for an award. Entries in the other two divisions require measurements for at least 95% (522) of the records. Qualified participants may receive more than one award.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update: (27 July 2006)</strong> If the time given for the PQ <em>follows</em> that given for the T end in any record, this record is treated as omitted when scores are calculated. If the PQ and T end measurements are not associated with the same beat, this is an error.</p>\n\n<p>You may revise your entry at any time until the final entry deadline of 4 September 2006 at 8 pm (2000) GMT. Each time you do so, your previous entry is discarded. Only the last entry received from each participant on or before the final entry deadline will be used to determine the winners of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exception: (added 13 April 2006)</strong> If you wish to enter independent sets of measurements made using substantially different methods (for example, a set of automated measurements in division 2 or 3, and a set of manual measurements in division 1), at the discretion of the organizers these may be considered simultaneously valid. If you believe that this exception should apply to your entries, please <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge%202006%20multiple%20entries\">write for approval and special instructions</a>, with a brief description of how your methods differ. This approval is not automatic and will require showing that the results of the two methods are significantly different.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>An unusual feature of this Challenge is that the &quot;gold standard&quot; (reference) QT interval measurements that are the basis for scoring each entry will be determined from the entries themselves during the course of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>For each record, the QT interval measurements obtained from the most recent entry submitted by each participant will be pooled to determine a median, which will be taken as the reference QT interval for that record. (<strong>Update 27 July 2006:</strong> Given the large number of division 1 (manual/semiautomated) entries, it is feasible now to determine the medians from the latest entry submitted by each <em>division 1</em> participant, and this has been done for medians and scores calculated on or after 27 July.) The score for each entry will be a function of the amount of agreement with the reference QT intervals and the number of records measured. Reference QT intervals and scores will be calculated at several times during the challenge; they will not be updated each time an entry is received.</p>\n\n<p>The score for each entry will be calculated as the RMS difference between the reference QT intervals and the corresponding QT intervals determined from the times listed in the entry, divided by the fraction of records in the challenge database for which measurements were submitted. Lower scores are better.</p>\n\n<p>Preliminary scores will be provided to participants shortly after the first deadline (24 April 2006), and updates will be supplied from time to time thereafter, each time the reference QT intervals are recalculated. Final scores will be emailed to participants on or about Wednesday, 6 September 2006.</p>\n\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n\n<p>During a plenary session of Computers in Cardiology in September, four awards of US$250 each will be presented to the eligible participants with the best (lowest) final scores as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Best overall (participants in all divisions eligible)</li>\n\t<li>Manual and semi-automated methods (division 1 only)</li>\n\t<li>Fully automated methods (divisions 2 and 3 eligible)</li>\n\t<li>Fully automated methods with source code submitted (division 3 only)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Entering Division 3</h3>\n\n<p>Authors of fully automated methods may enter division 3 by sending their source code by email, before noon GMT on Friday, 8 September 2006, to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge%202006%20entry%20source\">PhysioNet</a>. Use the subject line &quot;Challenge 2006 entry source&quot;, and be sure to include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Your name and email address</li>\n\t<li>All sources needed to produce a working version of your software (except for readily available standard libraries and header files)</li>\n\t<li>A note describing how to produce a working version of your software (a commented Makefile is ideal), and how to run your software</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each source file submitted should begin with a comment block containing the names of its authors and a reference to the open source license you have chosen for it, if any; for example:</p>\n\n<pre>     /* qtpom.c - Find QT intervals based on the phase of the moon\n        Copyright (C) 2006  Herman Foobar\n        This software is released under the terms of the GNU General\n        Public License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).\n     */\n</pre>\n\n<p>Source files in C, C++, Fortran, or Matlab m-code are preferred; other languages may be acceptable, but please ask first. Do not submit any code that cannot be freely redistributed. Note that entries in division 3 are eligible for three of the four awards (best overall, best fully automated method, and best open source method). Good luck!</p>\n\n<h3>Writing Abstracts and Papers for CINC</h3>\n\n<p>To be eligible for awards, participants in divisions 2 and 3 must submit abstracts about their work to Computers in Cardiology; division 1 participants are encouraged but not required to do so.</p>\n\n<p>The abstract due on 1 May 2006 is limited to about 400 words (no figures or tables may be included). For examples of abstracts that have been submitted by participants in past Challenges, see <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2005/cr.html\">these</a> <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2005/rp.html\">two</a> from the 2005 Challenge, or follow links in the top-scores tables for <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2000/top-scores.shtml\">2000</a>, <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2001/top-scores.shtml\">2001</a>, <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2002/top-scores.shtml\">2002</a>, and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2004/top-scores.shtml\">2004</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Abstracts must be submitted on-line on the <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/Submit.htm\">Computers in Cardiology web site</a>. When submitting your abstract, select &quot;Computers in Cardiology Challenge&quot; as the topic on the web form, so that your abstract can be identified easily by the abstract review committee.</p>\n\n<p>Successful abstracts include brief descriptions of the scope of the work, the methods used, the results, and conclusions. If accepted, these abstracts are printed in the scientific program book distributed at the conference, and those for Challenge entries are also posted here. They do not appear in print elsewhere; these are understood to be preliminary in nature and subject to revision between May and September. Nevertheless, you should include whatever preliminary results you have as of the time of the abstract submission; abstracts promising only that &quot;results will be presented&quot; are not accepted.</p>\n\n<p>If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a full 4-page paper describing your work in detail. This paper will have an abstract of its own, considerably shorter than the abstract you submitted for the program book. You can (and should) incorporate relevant results that you obtain during the months between submitting your original abstract and the deadline for the paper in September. You will receive your final score on or about 6 September 2006, about two weeks before your paper is due, so that it can be included in the paper if you wish.</p>\n\n<p>When you are ready to begin writing your paper, get the <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu/authkit/\">Author&#39;s Kit</a>, which includes templates and detailed instructions for preparing your manuscript in the required format and submitting it on-line. Examples of full CinC papers can be found in the Author&#39;s Kit and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/publications/publications-by-journal.shtml#3\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Your paper must be presented in an assigned oral or poster session at Computers in Cardiology in order for it to appear in print in the proceedings of the conference.</p>\n\n<h3>Important Dates</h3>\n\n<p>Late submissions will not be accepted.</p>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><strong>Monday, 24 April 2006, noon GMT</strong></dt>\n\t<dt>&nbsp;</dt>\n\t<dd>Deadline for submission of initial entries to PhysioNet.

Please don&#39;t wait until the last minute!</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p><a> </a></p>\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p><a>If your question is not answered below, please consult the </a><a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/faq.shtml\">PhysioNet FAQ</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I download the entire Challenge database in one step?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, but downloading the entire database is not necessary. See the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/faq.shtml#downloading-databases\">PhysioNet FAQ</a> for details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What happens when an entry is submitted?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a>Frequently Asked Questions</a>Once enough entries have been received, we will calculate the median QT interval reported for each record. Since it would be possible for an unscrupulous participant to bias the medians by submitting many entries with the same or slightly different measurements, only the last entry received from each participant is entered into the pool used to determine the medians. See <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/#eligible-entry\">Eligible entries</a> above for an exception to this rule.</p>\n\n<p>The median QT intervals determined in this way become the reference (&quot;gold standard&quot;) against which each participant&#39;s measurements are compared. Since new entries affect the medians, we will calculate new medians from time to time during the challenge, and we will recalculate scores at those times.</p>\n\n<p>Scores will be sent by email whenever new scores are calculated. Participants should expect to receive a preliminary score on or about Wednesday, 26 April 2006 (a few days before the CinC abstract deadline), and a final score on or about Wednesday, 6 September 2006 (about two weeks before the CinC final paper deadline). We expect that additional preliminary scores will be sent to participants at various other times during the spring and summer. Please be sure that your email address as recorded in your entry form is valid so that you will be able to receive your scores.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did the autoscorer reject my entry?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Eligible entries must be in plain text format, as in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/template.txt\">template</a>. Don&#39;t submit HTML documents, MS Word .doc files, spreadsheets, or anything else except plain text; the autoscorer won&#39;t like it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are the scores determined?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are two components of the score. First, we measure the mean of the squared differences between your QT interval measurements and the corresponding reference QT intervals, and take the square root of that number, to obtain the RMS error for your entry. (Since the time units are milliseconds, the units of RMS error are also milliseconds.) Second, we count the number of records measured in your entry, and divide that number by 549 (the total number of records in the challenge database), to obtain the yield for your entry. Your score is your RMS error divided by your yield; since yield is dimensionless, the units of the score are milliseconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do the scores mean, and what&#39;s a good score?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A lower score (ideally obtained with low RMS error and high yield) is always better. The best scores closely reflect the expected difference between a participant&#39;s measurements and the median of a set of manual measurements, in milliseconds. This interpretation of the score may be less appropriate when applied to poor scores, since low yield makes a score worse (higher).</p>\n\n<p>What constitutes a good score is subjective, but (as of 27 July) about a third of the scores in division 1 were near or below 20, and about a third of the division 2 and 3 scores were near or below 30.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can my score be changing if I haven&#39;t revised my measurements?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since the measurements contained in the submitted entries determine the reference QT intervals, your scores are not final until no more entries can be accepted. Preliminary scores based on available entries will be provided from time to time; the first scores will be emailed shortly after the first deadline in April.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I enter the challenge using previously published open-source software for fully automated QT interval measurement?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are the author of the software, yes, certainly!</p>\n\n<p>An entry produced by a functionally identical copy of someone else&#39;s code is not acceptable. If you are not the original author of the software, your entry is acceptable only if you have modified the original code in a non-trivial way, and if your QT interval measurements are no longer identical to those of the original software. It will be very difficult to establish the acceptability of a division 2 entry based on someone else&#39;s open source code, so if you are considering making such an entry, you are strongly encouraged to do so in division 3, where the significance of your modifications can be properly assessed.</p>\n\n<p>This policy is intended to protect the interests of any participants who might wish to publish their code before the conclusion of the Challenge, while still encouraging others to experiment with published algorithms and to contribute improvements to them if they can.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What license should be used for software entered in division 3?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Participants may choose any <a href=\"http://opensource.org/licenses/\">open source license</a> (or none at all). We use and recommend the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\">GPL</a> for our own software posted on PhysioNet, but this is not a requirement for the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I enter the challenge using a semi-automated method?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, you may participate in division 1. We also encourage you to submit an abstract to Computers in Cardiology and to submit your source code for possible posting on PhysioNet, but these are not requirements for division 1 participants.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I select a representative beat manually, and my software locates the PQ junction and T-wave end automatically. Which division should I enter? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Your method is semi-automated, since it requires human input; enter division 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Should I choose the first beat in the record as the representative beat even if the record begins in the middle of the QRS complex?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, definitely not! You should choose the first <em>representative</em> beat in the record, which for reasons discussed below will <em>never</em> (well, hardly ever) be the first beat.</p>\n\n<p>You can decide for yourself which beats are representative (typical), and you should choose one of them for your measurements. Among the characteristics that define a representative beat is that it should not immediately follow an atypical beat, because an atypical beat may (and usually does) influence the characteristics of the immediately following beat. This would tend to rule out using the first beat in any record, since the preceding beat cannot be examined and it is therefore not possible to say if it was atypical.</p>\n\n<p>If the first beat appears similar to the second beat and to most of the others in the record, and the second beat is clean, then the second beat is an ideal choice for the representative beat.</p>\n\n<p>If, after looking at the entire record, you decide that only the first beat is clean enough to measure, and that it looks typical, then use the first beat if you wish. This is the only situation in which you should consider choosing the first beat in a record, and it is unlikely to be necessary in the Challenge dataset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My software denoises the signals, so I don&#39;t need to choose a clean beat to measure. Does it really matter?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is certainly possible that your denoising may do an excellent job, but keep in mind that for the purposes of the Challenge, your measurements will be compared against those made by other participants, and that there are (real) beat-to-beat variations in QT interval. All other things being equal, your results will be best if you measure the same beat as the majority of other participants, so yes, it does really matter that you try to use the same criteria for choosing this beat as everyone else does!</p>\n\n<p>We specified the <em>first</em> representative beat in the record because even respiration-related interbeat interval variations may be reflected in the QT interval. Our hope is that most participants will choose one of a very small number of possibilities in each record, and that the inter-observer variability will be smaller than would be expected if each participant chose a random representative beat (and a wider variety of respiratory phases were sampled in the pooled data for each record).</p>\n\n<p>We could have left this problem out of the challenge by designating a specific beat to be measured in each record, but the issue of choosing a typical beat to characterize the record is an important aspect of arriving at a reliable method for measuring QT intervals, given current standards of clinical practice. It is certainly debatable whether measuring a QT interval from a single beat should ever be considered a reliable basis for making clinical decisions, but that&#39;s a debate for another time (and maybe another challenge!).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do you allow division 1 participants to measure only half of the database?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We want to encourage as many entries in division 1 as we can, and we expect that some participants will not have the time to measure the entire set of records in the challenge database. The inclusion of the yield (see &quot;How are the scores determined?&quot; above) in the score calculation is intended to give everyone, and especially participants in division 1, an incentive to measure as many records as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why don&#39;t you have a challenge about ...?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each year, we receive many suggestions for challenge topics.

Thanks also to Uwe Steinhoff and Raphael Schneider for compiling the reading list below.</p>\n\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\n\n<p>During the development of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/other.shtml#csedb\">CSE Database</a>, a &quot;median self-centering approach&quot; was followed to evaluate the performance of different algorithms for measuring ECG waveforms. The methods used in this Challenge for bootstrapping the determination of the reference QT intervals, and of scoring the entries, were inspired by this important and closely related work, which is described in these papers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Willems JL, Arnaud P, van Bemmel JH, Bourdillon PJ, Brohet C, Dalla Volta S, Andersen JD, Degani R, Denis B, Demeester M, et al. <a href=\"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/71/3/523.abstract\">Assessment of the performance of electrocardiographic computer programs with the use of a reference data base</a>.

The best score achieved by a manually reviewed entry was 6.67 ms (raw score: 6.65 ms, yield: 0.998), submitted by Mariano Llamedo Soria of the Universidad Tecnologica Nacional FRBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina. In all, seven entries in division 1 received scores below 20 ms. The best score achieved by an automated method was 16.34 ms (raw score: 15.53 ms, yield: 0.951), submitted by Dieter Hayn of ARC Seibersdorf Research GmbH, Graz, Austria. This entry achieved seventh place overall. The best score achieved by an open source automated method was 17.33 ms (raw score: 17.30 ms, yield: 0.998), by Yuriy Chesnokov of the Unilever Centre for Molecular Science Informatics, Cambridge University. This entry achieved ninth place overall, and second among all automated methods. In all, three entrants in divisions 2 and 3 earned scores below 20 ms, and six more received scores below 30 ms. An unofficial entry formed by combining the results of the three top entries in each of divisions 2 and 3 achieved a score of 10.93 ms (raw score: 10.39 ms, yield 0.951).</p>\n\n<h3>Papers</h3>\n\n<div>\n<p>These papers were presented at <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\"><em>Computers in Cardiology 2006</em></a>.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>The aim of Challenge 2007 is to establish how well one can characterize the location and extent of moderate to large, relatively compact infarcts using electrocardiographic evidence (supplemented by a model of the torso geometry and conductivity), in comparison with a &quot;gold standard&quot; expert analysis of gadolinium-enhanced MRI data.</p>\n\n<h3>Background</h3>\n\n<p>Any aspect of clinical medicine is best served by similarly excellent methods for both diagnosis and therapy. Regarding the common clinical problem of ischemic heart disease, the diagnostic methods are currently not as well developed as the therapeutic interventions. This &quot;mismatch&quot; exists despite clear understanding of both the underlying basic science and the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease and of its primary clinical manifestation, myocardial infarction. Two of the reasons for this mismatch are disconnections between basic and clinical scientists and disconnections between clinical applications of the multiple available individual diagnostic methods, for example, electrocardiography and myocardial imaging.</p>\n\n<p>This year&#39;s challenge, the eighth in the series, embraces the disciplines of both electrocardiography and (for the first time) imaging. Although we expect this challenge to be difficult, we also expect that it will attract the interest of a very broad portion of the PhysioNet and CinC communities.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge 2007 Development</h3>\n\n<p>The topic of this year&#39;s challenge, Electrocardiographic Imaging of Myocardial Infarction, was proposed by Galen Wagner (Duke University), chairman of the local organizing committee for the 2007 meeting of Computers in Cardiology (to be held in Durham, NC, USA from Sunday, 30 September through Wednesday, 3 October 2007). The VVRED (Virtual Visual Reconstructed Electrocardiographic Display) Group, led by Galen Wagner and by Rob MacLeod (University of Utah) has collected the data, and has developed the Challenge in collaboration with George Moody (MIT), representing PhysioNet.</p>\n\n<p>VVRED is an informal group of investigators that has had biannual meetings hosted by Fred Kornreich (Free University of Brussels) for the purpose of facilitating advances in ECG imaging [1]. During the 2nd VVRED meeting in June 2006, the group discussed the proposed challenge topic and accepted the role of assisting in its formal development. VVRED Group member Adriaan van Oosterom (University of Lausanne) volunteered to work with Galen Wagner and the MALT (Magnetic and Electrocardiographic Technologies) Group at the Glasgow Western Infirmary. The MALT studies have acquired serial paired ECG and cardiac MRI data in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The first of these studies [2] investigated the relationship between anatomic and electrical cardiac axis; the second (submitted for publication) addressed the limits of current ECG criteria for acute MI diagnosis.</p>\n\n<p>VVRED Group member Milan Hor&aacute;\u010dek (Dalhousie University) provided body surface potential mapping (BSPM) capability for MALT patients returning for their one-year follow-up MRI, and he is now conducting a study aimed at delineating healed infarcts based on body surface potential maps in 40 of these patients. He has worked with Galen Wagner, MALT physicist John Foster (University of Glasgow), and Adriaan van Oosterom to present this problem as the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2007.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge is open to a broad range of participants with and without experience in the area of electrocardiographic imaging. Participants from the clinical world (the non-modelers) and from the signal-processing world (the statistical, database-based approaches) are most welcome. The challenge was introduced during the CinC 2006 meeting in Valencia, Spain and is now being made available on the PhysioNet web site.</p>\n\n<h3>The Challenge Data</h3>\n\n<p><strong>All of the challenge data are available</strong><strong> in the data/ </strong><strong>subdirectory.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The MALT sub-study patients were first inventoried to determine the distribution of infarcts in the three major locations according to Selvester ECG criteria [3]. Based on the inventory and on the availability of all necessary data, the VVRED Group selected two &quot;training&quot; cases and two &quot;test&quot; cases, in each case with a moderate to large and relatively compact infarct. Although the labor-intensive nature of the data preparation process has necessarily resulted in a small number of training and test cases, we expect that this challenge will encourage development of larger data sets to support followup studies of promising methods.</p>\n\n<h3>Organization of the data</h3>\n\n<p><strong>All of the challenge data are available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2007/data/\">here</a>.</strong> Reference interpretations of the training cases are available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2007/training-set.txt\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The BSPM data, consisting of ECG data for 352 torso-surface sites, are provided in easy-to-read ASCII format for a single averaged PQRST complex sampled at 2kHz. These data contain the standard 12 leads, the 7 unweighted Frank leads and the Frank orthogonal XYZ leads (from which the vector loops may be constructed) as subsets.</p>\n\n<p>The anatomic locations of the 120 recording electrodes, and the locations of all 352 nodes on the torso surface for which ECG data are available, are provided as well. For case 3 (one of the two test cases) only, Fady Dawoud (Dalhousie University) has provided customized torso and ventricular geometry.</p>\n\n<p>To visualize the torso surface geometry and the BPSM data, you can use the <strong>map3d</strong> program, freely available from the <a href=\"http://www.sci.utah.edu/cibc/software/map3d.html\">University of Utah, SCI Institute.</a> Commands for using <strong>map3d</strong> on the challenge data are included in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2007/data/\">data directory</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Selected MRI sections through the heart from apex to base are also available. These images are from the patient&#39;s initial MRI study (outlines without gadolinium enhancement) to prevent disclosure of the infarct location based on shrinkage of the involved LV region during the later &quot;remodeling&quot; process. The data from the late enhancement image using gadolinium are provided for the training-set patients only.</p>\n\n<h3>Reporting Results and Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>First, download <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2007/entry.txt\">this sample entry form</a>.</li>\n\t<li>For each of the two test cases, participants must estimate one or more of the following:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>the extent of the infarct (the percentage of myocardial mass that is infarcted)</li>\n\t\t<li>the set of myocardial segments containing infarcted tissue</li>\n\t\t<li>the myocardial segment containing the centroid (&quot;center of mass&quot;) of the infarct (using 17-segment segmentation; see figures 3 and 4 in [14], reproduced <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2007/segmentation.html\">here</a>)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\tUse your favorite text editor to fill in as many of the fields in the sample entry form as you can with your estimates. Please note that the entry form is a plain text file, not a word processor document; keep it in plain text format. Be sure that your entry form includes the email address where you wish to have your scores sent.</li>\n\t<li>Send the filled-in entry by email to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge-2007-entry\">webmaster@physionet.org</a>, with the subject line &quot;Challenge-2007-entry&quot;. <strong>Entries will be accepted until noon GMT on 23 September 2007.</strong></li>\n\t<li>Entries will be compared against the &quot;gold standard&quot; (gadolinium enhanced images). The gold standard images are provided here for the two training cases only. The gold standard images for the two test cases are available only to the challenge organizers, who will score all entries; their decisions are final.</li>\n\t<li>Scores will be based on:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>EPD: Percentage discrepancy between the extent of the infarct as estimated and as determined from the gold standard.</li>\n\t\t<li>SO: Overlap between the sets of infarct segments as estimated and as determined from the gold standard.</li>\n\t\t<li>CED: Distance between the centroid of the infarct as estimated and as determined from the gold standard.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>You will receive your scores by return email. The first scores will be sent on or about 27 April 2007; scores for entries received after that date will usually be sent within a day of receipt.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given the estimated and gold standard sets of infarct segments, &quot;overlap&quot; (SO) is defined as the number of segments in both sets divided by the number of segments in either set (a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is a perfect match and 0 indicates that the sets are completely disjoint). Distance between the centroid estimates (CED) is defined as the number of segment boundaries crossed along the shortest path connecting the estimates.</p>\n\n<p>You will receive up to three scores (EPD, SO, and CED) for your entry, but each score represents the sum of the subscores obtained for each of the two test cases. Individual subscores will not be made available until after the end of the Challenge in September.</p>\n\n<h3>Events and Awards</h3>\n\n<p>If you submitted an abstract describing your work on the challenge no later than 7 May 2007 to Computers in Cardiology, you may be eligible for one or more awards that will be presented during the final plenary session of the conference on Wednesday, 3 October 2007.</p>\n\n<p>Three awards of US$250 each will be given to the participants who achieve the best (lowest) EPD, SO, and CED scores, and a fourth award of US$250 will be given to the participant who achieves the best average rank among all participants with respect to the other three events. <a> </a></p>\n\n<p><strong>New event added 6 August 2007:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Participants are invited to determine which nodes in the<a> </a><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2007/data/case0003-tri/case3_LV.tri\">long-axis LV model of case 3</a> lie above infarcted tissue. To enter this event, send a list of these nodes to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge-2007-entry\">webmaster@physionet.org</a>, with the subject line &quot;Challenge-2007-event-5-entry&quot;. Entries will be scored using an overlap measure similar to that defined for SO above. An award of US$250 will be provided to the most successful participant in this event.</p>\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p>If your question is not answered below, please consult the <a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/faq.shtml\">PhysioNet FAQ</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is a hard problem, and I won&#39;t be able to get final results in time for the abstract deadline. What needs to be submitted in the abstract?</strong></p>\n\n<p>[The abstract deadline has now passed, so this question and its answer are moot.]</p>\n\n<p>Briefly, you will need to submit a short (~300 words) abstract, which may not include illustrations, by 7 May.</p>\n\n<p>It would be ideal if you have submitted rough results for the Challenge problem no later than 3 May, so they can be scored and so that you can report your score in your abstract. If this is not possible, please discuss in your abstract relevant studies you have performed to date, touching on any novel aspects of your methods and quoting whatever results you have. Generally abstracts containing only &quot;we will show ...&quot; without any results are not accepted, so it is very important that you demonstrate in the abstract that you have actually accomplished something already. Given the complexity of the challenge and the short time available for working on it, the abstract reviewers will certainly make some allowance for those who are unable to obtain results on the challenge problem by the abstract deadline, if it appears they will be able to do so before the conference in September.</p>\n\n<p><a><strong>May I revise my entry?</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>You may submit entries at any time until the final deadline of noon GMT on 23 September. Each entry will be scored, and you may attempt to improve your score by submitting up to two revised entries. Only two revisions (three entries in all) are allowed in this challenge, since only a small number would be needed to obtain a good score simply by guessing, and we want to avoid that possibility!</p>\n\n<p>You may choose any of your (up to three) entries as the basis for ranking, by sending an email specifying your choice to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge-2007-entry\">webmaster@physionet.org</a>, on or before noon GMT on 23 September. Please remember that it may take up to 24 hours after submitting an entry to receive scores, so try to submit your last entry at least a day before the deadline if you think you may want to exercise your choice. Your last entry will be used for ranking unless you specify otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If my abstract is accepted, what else must I do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In September, if your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to submit a four-page paper, which may be illustrated, for publication in Computers in Cardiology on-line and in print. You will also be expected to attend the conference (30 September - 3 October 2007 in Durham, North Carolina, USA) and to present your work in one of the scientific sessions of the conference, either as a poster or as a 10-minute oral presentation. Your paper and presentation should include your final results.</p>\n\n<p>If you will need a visa in order to travel to the USA for the conference, please apply for it as soon as possible to avoid disappointment. The process of obtaining a visa to visit the USA has become very complicated and very slow in recent years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why don&#39;t you have a challenge about ...?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each year, we receive many suggestions for challenge topics. We encourage you to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=challenge-topic\"> write to us</a> with further suggestions.</p>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>MacLeod R, Kornreich F, van Oosterom A, Rautaharju P, Selvester R, Wagner GS, Zywietz C. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16216618&amp;dopt=Abstract\">Report of the first virtual visualization of the reconstructed electrocardiographic display symposium</a>.

They are Mohamed Mneimneh (Marquette University, Milwaukee, USA), Hamid SadAbadi (K.N. Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran), and Masood Ghasemi (K.N. Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran). Congratulations to them, and to all of the participants who tackled this very difficult challenge. <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2007/final-scores\">Final results</a> for all participants show that case 4 was particularly challenging. Interestingly, the best results were obtained from the ECG signals alone, without reference to the patient-specific torso models made possible from the MR images, suggesting that further improvement should be possible using the additional information.</p>\n\n<h3>Papers</h3>\n\n<div>\n<p>These papers were presented at <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\"><em>Computers in Cardiology 2007</em></a>.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>The ninth annual PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge aims to improve understanding of methods for identification and analysis of T-wave alternans in the ECG.</p>\n\n<h3>Background</h3>\n\n<p>One hundred years after the first observation of T-wave alternans was reported by HE Hering <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2008/#1\">[1]</a>, the phenomenon is widely understood to be an important indicator of risk of sudden cardiac death. Yet for most of that time TWA was believed to be rare. In 1981, at the eighth annual meeting of Computers in Cardiology, Dan Adam, Solange Akselrod, and Richard Cohen first reported the existence of microvolt-level T-wave alternans <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2008/#2\">[2]</a>, too small in amplitude to be detected visually at standard display scales.</p>\n\n<p>T-wave alternans (TWA) is a pattern in the ECG characterized by two (rarely more) distinct forms of T-waves appearing in alternation, at or above a patient-specific heart rate generally in the range of 90 to 120 beats per minute. Although the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated, a large amount of empirical evidence collected during the past 25 years has demonstrated an association between the amount of TWA, the heart rate at which it appears, and the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). In particular, the absence of significant TWA in a patient with congestive heart failure, low ejection fraction, or a recent myocardial infarction is strongly predictive of a low risk of SCD. A positive finding in such a patient, though less specific, may indicate that an implantable cardiac defibrillator would be appropriate, an indication that can be confirmed using invasive testing. Since TWA analysis is performed on the surface ECG, it is an inexpensive and non-invasive test. In clinical applications, TWA analysis can be done as part of an exercise stress test, but there is interest in the research community in using conventional long-term (Holter) ECG recordings to observe TWA in the context of activities of daily living. A review by Armoundas, Tomaselli, and Esperer discusses mechanisms that may account for the associations among TWA and other risk factors for SCD, as well as clinical applications of TWA <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2008/#3\">[3]</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A variety of algorithms for detecting and quantifying TWA have been proposed, employing techniques from linear and nonlinear signal processing such as spectral analysis, complex demodulation, counting zero-crossings in a series of correlation coefficients, periodogram and complex demodulation analysis of T-wave principal components, Capon filtering, Poincar&eacute; maps, periodicity transforms, statistical tests, moving averages, maximum likelihood estimators and generalized likelihood ratio tests, and more. For a comprehensive and systematic discussion of methods for TWA detection and analysis, see the review by Mart&iacute;nez and Olmos <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2008/#4\">[4]</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>The Challenge Data</h3>\n\n<p>PhysioNet has a wide variety of data that might be appropriate for this challenge. Visitors were invited to nominate some of these data for inclusion in the challenge data set, from among those in these databases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/\">Long-Term ST Database</a>, which consists of 86 records, each 21 to 24 hours in duration. The records are digitized 2- or 3-channel long-term (Holter) ECG tape recordings, mostly from subjects who had transient myocardial ischemia. Each record is annotated beat-by-beat, and with respect to ST and rhythm changes, and is accompanied by a detailed clincal summary.</li>\n\t<li>The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ptbdb/\">PTB Diagnostic ECG Database</a>, consisting of 549 records from 294 subjects, most of which are about 2 minutes long (some are shorter). These are of very high technical quality (12 standard leads and 3 Frank leads, sampled at 1 KHz per signal with 16-bit resolution), mostly post-MI patients but with representation of other types of subjects including healthy controls. Each record is accompanied by a detailed clinical summary. This database was previously used in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2006/\">2006 QT challenge</a>, and it might be interesting to relate QT intervals and TWA in the same subjects.</li>\n\t<li>The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/stdb/\">MIT-BIH ST Change Database</a>, which includes 23 high-quality records of exercise stress tests, each typically 20 to 40 minutes in length. The recordings each contain two ECG signals sampled at 360 Hz; there are no annotations or clinical correlates available.</li>\n\t<li>The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/pn3/sddb/\">Sudden Cardiac Death Holter Database</a> <a href=\"http://physionet.org/pn3/sddb\">[alternate link]</a>, a collection that currently includes 23 complete 2-channel Holter recordings (7 to 25 hours each) of patients who experienced sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and cardiac arrest during the recordings. The records have been digitized at 250 Hz per signal. Twelve records have been meticulously annotated beat-by-beat; algorithm-generated beat annotations are available for the others. No clinical correlates are available.</li>\n\t<li>The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/chfdb/\">BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database</a>, 15 2-channel Holter recordings each about 20 hours in duration, from patients with severe (NYHA class 3-4) congestive heart failure. The records have been digitized at 250 Hz per signal. Age, gender, and NYHA class are available for each patient.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A good challenge data set should include not only clear-cut cases, but also a sampling of cases that might be expected to pose problems (for example, because of changes in conduction patterns, ectopy, or noise).</p>\n\n<p>Participants were asked send a list of the records they wished to nominate for inclusion in the official challenge data set by email to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge 2008 data nomination\">webmaster@physionet.org</a> with the subject &quot;Challenge 2008 data nomination&quot;, no later than noon GMT on Thursday, 17 April 2008. Those who wished to nominate records other than those in the databases listed above were asked to state briefly why they believed their choices are particularly appropriate for this challenge. Participants also were invited to contribute data to PhysioNet to be considered for this challenge, and several did so. Thanks to all who participated in this process.</p>\n\n<p>We have compiled all nominations and selected the most promising cases for inclusion in the official data set, together with new cases that have not been available previously. The official PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2008 data set is now available (as individual files) <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/twadb/\">here</a>; for convenience, it is also available as a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2008/twadb.tar.gz\">tarball</a> (see instructions <a href=\"https://physionet.org/faq.shtml#tar-gz\">here</a> for unpacking tarballs).</p>\n\n<p>If you downloaded the data set before Monday, 21 April 2008, you can bring your copy up-to-date using the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2008/twadb-update.tar.gz\">update tarball</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Reporting Results and Scoring</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Download an <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2008/entry.txt\">entry form</a>.</li>\n\t<li>For each record in the challenge data set, participants must detect or estimate the peak magnitude of T-wave alternans using a fully-automated method, and enter that estimate on the entry form. If your method detects but does not quantify TWA, enter 1 as the estimate for each record in which TWA was detected, and 0 as the estimate for the remaining records. <strong>Valid entries must include a TWA estimate for each record in the challenge data set.</strong></li>\n\t<li>Use your favorite text editor to fill in the entry form. Please note that the entry form is a plain text file, not a word processor document; keep it in plain text format. <strong>Be sure that your entry form includes the email address where you wish to have your scores sent.</strong></li>\n\t<li>Send the filled-in entry by email to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge-2008-entry\"> webmaster@physionet.org</a>, with the subject line &quot;Challenge 2008 entry&quot;. <strong>Entries will be accepted until noon GMT on 1 September 2008.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Scores will be determined by the following procedure, once a minimum number of entries have been received:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>For each entry, the records will be ranked by the magnitudes of the associated TWA estimates. Thus the record with the lowest TWA estimate in a given entry receives the rank of 1 for that entry, the record with the second-lowest TWA estimate gets a rank of 2, etc.</li>\n\t<li>Each record receives a median rank, which is the median of the ranks assigned it by the entries, and a reference ranking is made by sorting the median ranks (i.e., the record with the lowest median rank gets a reference rank of 1, etc.)</li>\n\t<li>The score for each entry is the Kendall (tau) rank correlation coefficient between the entry ranking and the reference ranking, where 1 is perfect agreement and -1 is perfect disagreement <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2008/#5\">[5]</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You will receive your score by return email. The first scores will be sent on or about 27 April 2008; scores for entries received after that date will usually be sent within a day of receipt.</p>\n\n<p><em>The reference rankings are initially determined by the entries received. Final reference rankings will be compiled in August. Scores reported before that time are preliminary and are subject to change. Final scores used to determine the winners of the challenge will be sent to all participants shortly after the deadline for entries (1 September 2008).</em></p>\n\n<h3>Entering the Open Source Division</h3>\n\n<p>As in previous years, the Challenge will include an open source division. You may enter the open source division by sending your source code by email, before noon GMT on Monday, 1 September 2008, to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge 2008 entry source\">PhysioNet</a>. Use the subject line &quot;Challenge 2008 entry source&quot;, and be sure to include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Your name and email address</li>\n\t<li>All sources needed to produce a working version of your software (except for readily available standard libraries and header files)</li>\n\t<li>A note describing how to produce a working version of your software (a commented Makefile is ideal), and how to run your software</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each source file submitted should begin with a comment block containing the names of its authors and a reference to the open source license you have chosen for it, if any; for example:</p>\n\n<pre>     /* twarng.c - Detect and measure T-wave alternans using a random number generator\n        Copyright (C) 2008  Herman Foobar &lt;hbar@uncertain.org&gt;\n        This software is released under the terms of the GNU General\n        Public License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).\n     */\n</pre>\n\n<p>Source files in C, C++, Fortran, or Matlab m-code are preferred; other languages may be acceptable, but please ask first. Do not submit any code that cannot be freely redistributed. Following the conclusion of the Challenge, selected entries will be posted, with full credit to their authors, on PhysioNet.</p>\n\n<h3>Events and Awards</h3>\n\n<p>If you submit an abstract describing your work on the challenge no later than 1 May 2008 to Computers in Cardiology, and a challenge entry no later than 1 September 2008 at noon GMT, you may be eligible for one or more awards that will be presented during the final plenary session of the conference on Wednesday, 17 September 2008.</p>\n\n<p>The Board of Directors of Computers in Cardiology provides an annual grant of US$1000 for challenge awards. This year, a matching contribution from Electrogram, Inc. has allowed us to double the prize fund. We are deeply grateful for the generosity and enthusiastic support of Electrogram and Computers in Cardiology.</p>\n\n<p>An award of US$1000 will be received by the eligible participant who achieves the best final score overall in this year&#39;s Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>An additional award of US$1000 will be given to the winner of the open source division. <strong>Participants in the open source division are eligible for both awards.</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n\n<p>If your question is not answered below, please consult the <a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/faq.shtml\">PhysioNet FAQ</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regarding the estimate of the peak T-wave alternans magnitude, in what units it should be expressed? Does the estimate include the T-wave magnitude or only the added alternans?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You may use whatever units you wish. Estimate the magnitude of the alternans, not the magnitude of the T-waves. (Some methods involve expressing alternans magnitude or power as a fraction of total T-wave magnitude or power; it&#39;s fine to do this, or not to do this, as you wish -- but don&#39;t <em>add</em> a T-wave measurement to your alternans estimate.)</p>\n\n<p>The scoring is based on how your estimates rank the records (from least to most TWA) compared with a reference ranking of the records. Thus the units you choose don&#39;t matter, so long as you use the same units for all of your measurements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is a hard problem, and I won&#39;t be able to get final results in time for the abstract deadline. What needs to be submitted in the abstract?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Briefly, you will need to submit a short (~300 words) abstract, which may not include illustrations, by 1 May. Abstracts must be submitted <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/Submit.htm\">on-line</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It would be ideal if you have submitted rough results for the Challenge problem no later than 27 April, so they can be scored and so that you can report your preliminary score in your abstract. If this is not possible, please discuss in your abstract relevant studies you have performed to date, touching on any novel aspects of your methods and quoting whatever results you have. Generally abstracts containing only &quot;we will show ...&quot; without any results are not accepted, so it is very important that you demonstrate in the abstract that you have actually accomplished something already. Given the complexity of the challenge and the short time available for working on it, the abstract reviewers will certainly make some allowance for those who are unable to obtain results on the challenge problem by the abstract deadline, if it appears they will be able to do so before the conference in September.</p>\n\n<p><a><strong>May I revise my entry?</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>You may submit entries at any time until the final deadline of noon GMT on 1 September. Each entry will be scored, and you may attempt to improve your score by submitting up to four revised entries (five in all).</p>\n\n<p>You may choose any of your (up to five) entries as the basis for ranking, by sending an email specifying your choice to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge-2008-entry\">webmaster@physionet.org</a>, on or before noon GMT on 1 September. Please remember that it may take up to 24 hours after submitting an entry to receive scores, so try to submit your last entry at least a day before the deadline if you think you may want to exercise your choice. Your last entry will be used for ranking unless you specify otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If my abstract is accepted, what else must I do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In September, if your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to submit a four-page paper, which may be illustrated, for publication in <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu/archives/\">Computers in Cardiology on-line</a> and in print. You will also be expected to attend the conference (<a href=\"http://cinc2008.unibo.it/\">14-17 September 2008 in Bologna, Italy</a>) and to present your work in one of the scientific sessions of the conference, either as a poster or as a 10-minute oral presentation. Your paper and presentation should include your final results.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why don&#39;t you have a challenge about ...?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each year, we receive many suggestions for challenge topics.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>Among the most critical events that occur in intensive care units (ICUs), acute hypotensive episodes require effective, prompt intervention. Left untreated, such episodes may result in irreversible organ damage and death. Timely and appropriate interventions can reduce these risks. Determining what intervention is appropriate in any given case depends on diagnosing the cause of the episode, which might be sepsis, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage, dehydration, anaphylaxis, effects of medication, or any of a wide variety of other causes of hypovolemia, insufficient cardiac output, or vasodilatory shock. Often the best choice may be a suboptimal but relatively safe intervention, simply to buy enough time to select a more effective treatment without exposing the patient to the additional risks of delaying treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Of the 2320 patients whose monitored waveforms and accompanying clinical data were included in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2db\">MIMIC II Database</a> as of December 2008, arterial blood pressure was recorded in 1237 (53%); among these 1237 patients, 511 (41%) experienced recorded episodes of acute hypotension (as defined <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2009/#ahe\">below</a>) during their ICU stays. The mortality rate for these 511 patients is more than twice that of the MIMIC II population as a whole. To the extent that one might forecast acute hypotensive episodes in the ICU, there is a possibility of improving care and survival of patients at risk of these events.</p>\n\n<p>This year&#39;s challenge is the tenth in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/\">annual series of open challenges</a> hosted by PhysioNet in cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology</a>. The goal of the challenge is to predict which patients in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2009/#dataset\">challenge dataset</a> will experience an <em>acute hypotensive episode</em> beginning within the <em>forecast window</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\n\n<p><a><strong>Acute Hypotensive Episode</strong></a>: The challenge dataset includes, for each case, a time series of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at one-minute intervals. Each sample of the series is an average of the blood pressure measured in the radial artery over the previous minute. Given such a time series, an <em>acute hypotensive episode</em> (AHE) is defined for the purposes of this challenge as any period of 30 minutes or more during which at least 90% of the MAP measurements were at or below 60 mmHg.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Forecast window</strong>: This is defined as the one-hour period immediately following a specified time <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>. In the test sets, the forecast window (and indeed all data following <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>) are withheld, and the forecast must be made using only information available before <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>The Challenge Dataset</h3>\n\n<p>The MIMIC II project has collected data from about 30,000 ICU patients to date. MIMIC II patient records contain most of the information that would appear in a medical record (such as results of laboratory tests, medications, and hourly vital signs). About 5,000 of the records also include physiologic waveforms (typically including ECG, blood pressure, and respiration, and often other signals as well) and time series that can be observed by the ICU staff. The intent is that a MIMIC II record should be sufficiently detailed to allow its use in studies that would otherwise require access to an ICU, e.g., for basic research in intensive care medicine, or for development and evaluation of diagnostic and predictive algorithms for medical decision support.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge dataset consists of selected patient records from the MIMIC II Database. In the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2009/training-set.shtml\"><em>training set</em></a>, the records include all available data before and after <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>. In the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/pn3/challenge/2009/\"><em>test sets</em></a>, the records are truncated at <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>; the data recorded after <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong> in each case will be made available for study only after the conclusion of the challenge. (<strong>Update 2 September 2009:</strong> The previously withheld data are now available; see the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/pn3/challenge/2009/\">test set home page</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Not all MIMIC II records include all of the data elements needed for this challenge. Records chosen for the challenge dataset include, at a minimum:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>At least 10 hours of data before <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>, and at least one hour of data after <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>. (As noted, data collected after <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong> for the test set records will be withheld until after the conclusion of the challenge in September, 2009.) Most MIMIC II records are significantly longer, and many include a week or more of data.</li>\n\t<li>ECG and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals sampled at 125 Hz. Records in the training set may include one or two additional signals, and those in the test set may include as many as six additional signals. (Note that two records in the training set do not include these signals, however.)</li>\n\t<li>Time series of vital signs sampled once per minute (in the training set) and once per second (in the test sets). These include heart rate and mean, systolic, and diastolic ABP. Most records include a variety of additional vital-signs time series, most often including respiration rate and SpO<sub>2</sub>.</li>\n\t<li>Clinical data entered into the ICU medical information systems (records of observations, measurements, and interventions performed in the ICU). These include intravenous medications and fluids as well as other medications administered. Note, however, that some of this information is manually entered by the ICU staff at times when it is possible to do so without compromising patient care, so the associated timestamps may be imprecise.</li>\n\t<li>Results of laboratory tests, records of medications ordered, and other data gathered in the hospital but outside of the ICU.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>MIMIC II records meeting the criteria above are assigned to a group (H or C) and a subgroup (H1, H2, C1, or C2):</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Records in <strong>group H</strong> contain an episode of acute hypotension beginning during the forecast window (the one-hour period following <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>).\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Records in <strong>subgroup H1</strong> come from patients who received pressor medication.</li>\n\t\t<li>Records in <strong>subgroup H2</strong> come from patients who did not receive pressor medication (i.e., those in group H but not in subgroup H1).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Records in <strong>group C</strong> contain no episodes of acute hypotension within the forecast window.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Records in <strong>subgroup C1</strong> come from patients with no documented acute hypotensive episodes at any time during their hospital stay.</li>\n\t\t<li>Records in <strong>subgroup C2</strong> come from patients who had AHE before or after the forecast window (i.e., those in group C but not in subgroup C1).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2009/training-set.shtml\"><strong>training set</strong></a> consists of 60 records (including data after <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>15 from subgroup H1 (AHE treated with pressors)</li>\n\t<li>15 from subgroup H2 (AHE not treated with pressors)</li>\n\t<li>15 from subgroup C1 (no AHE)</li>\n\t<li>15 from subgroup C2 (AHE outside the forecast window)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://physionet.org/pn3/challenge/2009/test-set-a\"><strong>Test set A</strong></a> consists of 10 records (excluding data after <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>5 from subgroup H1 (AHE in subjects receiving pressors)</li>\n\t<li>5 from subgroup C1 (no AHE, in subjects receiving pressors)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://physionet.org/pn3/challenge/2009/test-set-b\"><strong>Test set B</strong></a> consists of 40 records (excluding data after <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Between 10 and 16 from group H</li>\n\t<li>Between 24 and 30 from group C</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Changes in the Events and Group Definitions</h3>\n\n<p>Originally, subgroup H1 was defined as patients who received pressor medication in response to their AHE, and subgroup C1 included some patients who did not receive pressors. These definitions were used to construct the training set. Although not explicitly stated as a selection criterion, none of these patients received pressors before <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong>, so the administration of pressors was not a clue that could have been used to classify them.</p>\n\n<p>In selecting the test sets, however, it became apparent that cases meeting the original criteria for subgroup H1 were less common than anticipated. By including cases in which pressors were already being given, we were able to obtain a sufficient number of cases in subgroup H1, but now the problem was that if they were included, it would be possible to classify them simply by observing that pressors were being given. The solution was to redefine subgroups H1 and C1 to include <em>only</em> records of patients who received pressors, so that, as in the training set, the presence of pressors per se does not indicate to which group a record belongs.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Events</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Event 1</strong> focuses on distinguishing between two groups of ICU patients who are receiving pressor medication: patients who experience an acute hypotension episode, and patients who do not. These two groups represent extremes of AHE-associated risk. Designing successful methods for separating these disjoint populations may lead to finding indices that are prognostic of AHE in these individuals.</p>\n\n<p>To enter event 1, design and implement an automated method to identify which of the records in test set A belong to subgroup H1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 2</strong> aims to address the broad question of predicting AHE in a population in which about a third of the patients experience AHE (as in the MIMIC II Database as a whole). It is likely that a variety of methods can be used to identify different subsets of the patients at risk; for example, those who have had previous documented AHE (especially if more than once) may be relatively easy to identify, on the basis of a priori knowledge of their pathophysiology or of their response to medication. The potential benefits of finding AHE predictors for even a modest subset of the at-risk patients may be significant, if improvement in outcome can be shown to follow from increased vigilance and preparation for effective intervention in these patients.</p>\n\n<p>To enter event 2, design and implement an automated method to identify which of the records in test set B belong to group H.</p>\n\n<h3>Entering the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p><em>The Challenge has concluded, but it is still possible to attempt the challenge problem, since the data will remain available. Follow the links to the correct classifications at the top of this page in order to determine the accuracy of your predictions. The remainder of this page describes the rules for official participants in the Challenge.</em></p>\n\n<p>We recommend studying the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2009/training-set.shtml\">training set</a> records as preparation for the Challenge itself. The opportunity to see what happens after <strong>T<sub>0</sub></strong> in these records will be invaluable in designing successful strategies for predicting acute hypotensive episodes in the test set records.</p>\n\n<p>Download challenge entry forms for <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2009/entry-1.txt\">event 1</a> and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2009/entry-2.txt\">event 2</a>, then follow the instructions on the forms to fill in your algorithm&#39;s classifications and return them for scoring. <strong>Be sure that your entry form(s) include the email address where you wish to have your score(s) sent.</strong> In each event, the score is simply the fraction of correct classifications (a number between 0 and 1; higher scores are better).</p>\n\n<p>To be eligible for an award:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Design and implement an automated method for classifying the records in one or both test sets, and record your method&#39;s classifications in an entry form.</li>\n\t<li>Submit at least one valid entry (to either event) no later than noon GMT on Wednesday, 6 May 2009.</li>\n\t<li>Submit an abstract (about 300 words) describing your work on the Challenge to <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computers in Cardiology</a> (CinC). Please select &quot;PhysioNet/CinC Challenge&quot; as the topic of your abstract, so that it can be identified easily by the abstract review committee. The deadline for submitting abstracts is 8 May 2009.</li>\n\t<li>Attend Computers in Cardiology in Park City, Utah (USA), 13-16 September 2009.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Entries for event 1 must assign exactly 5 records from test set A to subgroup H1, and entries for event 2 must assign 10 to 16 records from test set B to group H. <strong>Entries that do not follow this rule are invalid and will not be scored.</strong> You may enter each event up to <strong>four</strong> times. These restrictions are intended to limit the opportunity for a good score based on a lucky guess, or a series of deductions as in <a href=\"http://www.lizardpoint.com/fun/mastermind/mastmind.html\">Mastermind</a>. The deadline for revised entries is noon GMT on Monday, 31 August 2009.</p>\n\n<p>If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page paper for publication in Computers in Cardiology, and to present a talk or poster about your work at CinC.</p>\n\n<p>During a plenary session of Computers in Cardiology in September, four awards will be presented to the eligible participants in attendance with the best final scores as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Best <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2009/#open-source-entry\">open source entry</a> in event 1</li>\n\t<li>Best entry in event 1</li>\n\t<li>Best open-source entry in event 2</li>\n\t<li>Best entry in event 2</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Participants may enter one or both events, and open source entries are eligible for the overall awards as well as for the open source awards. If the best results in any category are achieved by two or more entries, the first of these entries to be submitted will receive the award in that category.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Important!</em></strong> The challenge is to design an <strong>automated</strong> method for classifying the records. You are welcome to submit an entry based on your personal interpretation of the data, but it will not be scored until the conclusion of the challenge, and it will not be eligible for an award. (If you do very well, however, your achievement will be recognized on PhysioNet.) Obviously this rule is difficult to enforce; please respect the spirit of the challenge.</p>\n\n<h3>Entering the Open Source Division</h3>\n\n<p>As in previous years, the Challenge includes an open source division. You may enter the open source division by sending the source code for your classifier by email, before noon GMT on Tuesday, 1 September 2009, to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge 2009 entry source\">PhysioNet</a>. Use the subject line &quot;Challenge 2009 entry source&quot;, and be sure to include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Your name and email address</li>\n\t<li>All sources needed to produce a working version of your software (except for readily available standard libraries and header files)</li>\n\t<li>A note describing how to produce a working version of your software (a commented Makefile is ideal), and how to run your software</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each source file submitted should begin with a comment block containing the names of its authors and a reference to the open source license you have chosen for it, if any; for example:</p>\n\n<pre>     /* predict_ahe.c - forecast acute hypotension using artificial intuition\n        Copyright (C) 2009  Herman Foobar &lt;hbar@uncertain.org&gt;\n        This software is released under the terms of the GNU General\n        Public License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).\n     */\n</pre>\n\n<p>Source files in C, C++, Fortran, or Matlab m-code are preferred; other languages may be acceptable, but please ask first.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>In settings ranging from sleep studies to surgery to sports medicine to intensive care, real-time monitoring of a variety of physiologic signals has become an essential tool for clinicians and researchers. Transient corruption or loss of one or more signals, common in all of these settings, can be disruptive, especially when continuous observations are required in order to rule out rare events or as a basis for forecasting. Signal corruption can be particularly challenging when it mimics features that are associated with pathologic states.</p>\n\n<p>Humans can be remarkably adept at dealing with transient noise and signal loss in these settings. Filling in gaps, and making use of context to recognize and ignore noise, are processes that our sensory and cognitive abilities leave us well-equipped to do. Can algorithmic solutions that take account of the same data, in broader contexts and without fatigue, do as well?</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this year&#39;s challenge is to develop robust methods for filling in gaps in multiparameter physiologic data (including ECG signals, continuous blood pressure waveforms, and respiration). In a real-world monitoring application, these methods can be applied for many purposes, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>robust estimation of parameters such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and respiration when the primary signals used to derive these parameters become unavailable or unreliable;</li>\n\t<li>detection of changes in patient state, when the relationships between signals remain consistent even as individual signals change their behavior; and</li>\n\t<li>recognition of intervals of signal corruption, when a signal becomes inconsistent not only with respect to its previous history but also with respect to its relationships with other signals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this Challenge, participants are asked to reconstruct, using any combination of available prior and concurrent information, segments of signals that have been removed from multiparameter recordings of patients in intensive care units (ICUs).</p>\n\n<h3>Data for the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>Participants are provided with three data sets of 100 records each. Each ten-minute record contains 6, 7, or 8 signals acquired from bedside ICU patient monitors. The recorded signals vary across records, and they include ECG, continuous invasive blood pressure, respiration, fingertip plethysmograms, and occasional other signals. In one of these signals, the final 30-second segment (the <em>target signal</em>) has been replaced by a gap (a flat line signal), and the goal is to reconstruct this missing 30-second target signal in each record.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Set A</strong> is a set of 100 records for participants&#39; use as a training set. Participants can obtain scores for Set A reconstructions at any time, but Set A scores are not included in the final rankings of Challenge entries. The target signals are provided for the records in this set. Additional training data can easily be constructed from any of the multiparameter data available in PhysioBank, such as the MIMIC II Waveform Database.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Set B</strong> is a set of 100 records for which the target signals are withheld until the conclusion of the challenge. Participants can obtain scores for Set B reconstructions at any time, but Set B scores are not included in the final rankings of Challenge entries.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Set C</strong> is a set of 100 records, with the target signals withheld. Participants may submit reconstructions of the target signals at any time for the duration of the challenge, but they will not receive scores except for their final submissions, which will determine the final rankings and the winners of the challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Records in all three Challenge data sets are provided in standard PhysioBank (compact binary) formats; read them using the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB software package</a>, use the PhysioBank <a href=\"http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/ATM\">ATM</a> to convert them to text, CSV, Matlab, or EDF formats, or see <a href=\"https://physionet.org/tutorials/physiobank-text.shtml\">How to obtain PhysioBank data in text form</a> for notes on other methods for converting them to text. The Set A files named with the suffix .missing are the target signals; these files are in text format.</p>\n\n<p>The data sets, together with the target signals for Set A, are available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2010/\">here</a>. To download them efficiently, use rsync as described <a href=\"https://physionet.org/faq.shtml#downloading-databases\">here</a> (retrieve the challenge-2010 &quot;module&quot;). For convenience, a tarball containing the full contents of all three data sets is available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2010-data.tar.gz\">here</a> (196,792,152 bytes); see <a href=\"https://physionet.org/faq.shtml#tar-gz\">this note</a> for information about unpacking tarballs.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>A detailed reconstruction of a signal, reproducing all characteristics of the original signal accurately, is more than is necessary in order to be useful. For example, a reconstruction of an invasive blood pressure signal may be useful if it allows a good estimation of mean pressure, or pulse pressure, even if none of the other details of the signal can be reproduced accurately; as another example, a reconstruction of an ECG signal that allows accurate estimation of RR intervals may be useful, even in the absence of other details.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, this challenge makes use of two scoring algorithms, detailed below. The first, used in event 1, measures the overall accuracy of the reconstruction, and as such will tend to favor those reconstruction methods that succeed in recovering properties of the signal that are derivable from the signal amplitude, such as MAP and pulse pressure. The second, used in event 2, is based on the correlation between the original signal and its reconstruction, and tends to favor those methods that accurately recover the timing of the major fluctuations in the original signal, such as QRS complexes in the ECG needed to derive RR interval series. Each reconstruction is scored using both algorithms, so a single submission is entered in both events of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring for individual reconstructions</h3>\n\n<p>Each <em>reconstruction, <strong>V<sub>rec</sub></strong></em>, is compared with the corresponding <em>target (reference) signal, <strong>V<sub>ref</sub></strong></em>. Target signals are known in all cases, but those for the Set B and Set C records are not provided to participants.</p>\n\n<p>Each submitted reconstruction is scored using two different methods, one for each of the two events. Since the scoring methods for the two events have different biases, a change in your reconstruction of a given record may improve your event 1 score and decrease your event 2 score, or vice versa.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Event 1</strong></h4>\n\n<p>The target signal is subtracted (sample by sample) from the reconstruction to obtain the residual signal, <strong>V<sub>res</sub></strong>. The sum of the squares of the residuals, <strong>ssvres</strong>, is normalized by the energy (sample variance) of the target signal, <strong>E<sub>ref</sub></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In event 1, the quality, <strong>Q<sub>1</sub></strong>, of a reconstruction is defined as 1&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>ssvres</strong>/<strong>E<sub>ref</sub></strong>, or 0, whichever is larger. If <strong>ssvres</strong> is 0, <em><strong>Q<sub>1</sub></strong></em> is 1, even if <strong>E<sub>ref</sub></strong> is also 0.</p>\n\n<p>Use of a figure of merit based on the residual signal reflects the importance in many cases of obtaining a good estimate of target signal levels (such as systolic, mean, and diastolic pressures in a continuous blood pressure signal).</p>\n\n<p>[Note that <em><strong>Q<sub>1</sub></strong></em> was previously defined as 1&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>E<sub>res</sub></strong>/<strong>E<sub>ref</sub></strong>, or 0, whichever is larger (where <strong>E<sub>res</sub></strong> is the energy of the residual signal). This definition was changed because it was independent of the magnitude of any constant (DC) component of the residual signal, unlike the revised definition.]</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Event 2</strong></h4>\n\n<p>In event 2, the quality <em><strong>Q<sub>2</sub></strong></em> of a reconstruction is defined as the correlation coefficient of <em><strong>V<sub>ref</sub></strong></em> and <em><strong>V<sub>rec</sub></strong></em>, or 0, whichever is larger. (Correlation coefficients can of course be negative; for the purposes of this challenge, an anticorrelated reconstruction is equivalent to an uncorrelated one, however.)</p>\n\n<p>Use of the correlation coefficient as a figure of merit is motivated by the observation that reconstruction of a filtered signal may be useful in many cases. Such a reconstruction might, for example, provide a basis for reliable estimation of the timing of major fluctuations in a signal (such as QRS complexes in an ECG signal), even if absolute signal levels are not recovered. Unlike <em><strong>Q<sub>1</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>Q<sub>2</sub></strong></em> is relatively insensitive to misestimation of the amplitudes of fluctuations.</p>\n\n<h3>Aggregate (summed) scores</h3>\n\n<p>The final ranking of participants is based on summing the <em><strong>Q</strong></em> scores obtained for records in Set C. Participants are encouraged, but not required, to provide reconstructions of all records in Set C.</p>\n\n<p>Both <em><strong>Q<sub>1</sub></strong></em> and <em><strong>Q<sub>2</sub></strong></em> are defined so they can vary between 0 and 1, and higher values are better. If you have submitted more than one reconstruction of the same record, only the last one submitted determines your <em><strong>Q<sub>1</sub></strong></em> and <em><strong>Q<sub>2</sub></strong></em> for that record. If you have not submitted a reconstruction for a given record, your <em><strong>Q<sub>1</sub></strong></em> and <em><strong>Q<sub>2</sub></strong></em> scores for that record are zero.</p>\n\n<p>For event 1, your Set C summed score, <em><strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong></em>, is the sum of the your final <em><strong>Q<sub>1</sub></strong></em> scores for each record in Set C. Similarly, for event 2, your Set C summed score, <em><strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong></em>, is the sum of the your final <em><strong>Q<sub>2</sub></strong></em> scores for each record in Set C. Since Set C contains 100 records, <em><strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong></em> and <em><strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong></em> can vary between 0 and (in theory!) 100.</p>\n\n<p>The summed scores are not normalized by the number of target signals reconstructed, to provide a strong incentive to submit reconstructions of as many of the Set C records as possible.</p>\n\n<h3>Entering the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>To register as a participant in the Challenge:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://physionet.org/pnw/login\">create a PhysioNetWorks home page</a>.</li>\n\t<li>On your newly-created home page, click on the designated link to enter the Challenge.</li>\n\t<li>When you next visit your home page, links for submitting reconstructions and viewing your scores will appear there.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To be eligible for an award (see below), also:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li>Submit reconstructions (see below) of at least 10 Set B target signals, no later than noon GMT on Friday, 30 April 2010.</li>\n\t<li>Submit an abstract (about 300 words) describing your work on the Challenge to <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computing in Cardiology </a> (CinC) by Saturday, 1 May 2010. Please select &quot;PhysioNet/CinC Challenge&quot; as the topic of your abstract, so it can be identified easily by the abstract review committee.</li>\n\t<li>Submit reconstructions of as many Set C target signals as you wish no later than noon GMT on Wednesday, 1 September 2010. Since your ranking is determined by the sum of the scores you receive for Set C targets, it is to your advantage to attempt as many of the 100 Set C records as possible.</li>\n\t<li>Attend Computing in Cardiology in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 26-29 September.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If your abstract is accepted, you will be expected to prepare a four-page paper for publication in Computing in Cardiology, and to present a talk or poster about your work at CinC.</p>\n\n<h3>Submitting reconstructions for scoring</h3>\n\n<p>Reconstructions should be in the same format as the .missing files containing the Set A target signals (text format, with one sample of the reconstructed signal per line). Each file should contain 3750 samples (125 samples/second, for 30 seconds). Although the target signals consist entirely of samples with integer values, reconstructions may contain integer or floating point values. Use a decimal point (.) rather than a comma (,) to separate the integral and fractional components of floating point values.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the links from your PhysioNetWorks home page (see above) to submit reconstructions and to view your Set A and B individual record scores, <em><strong>Q<sub>1</sub></strong></em> and <em><strong>Q<sub>2</sub></strong></em>, as well as your Set A and B summed scores, <em><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong></em>, <em><strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong></em>, and <em><strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>You may replace any previously submitted reconstruction simply by submitting a new one. The corresponding scores are updated immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Scores are calculated using the code in <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2010/c2010-score.c\">c2010-score.c</a>, a short C program that you may download and use to compare any two time series.</p>\n\n<p>Participants may submit reconstructions of as many Set A, B, and C target signals as they wish. Each reconstruction is scored separately. For each event, the final ranking of participants is based on the sum of the scores obtained for reconstructions of Set C target signals.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that Sets A and B are intended for experimentation with your methods for reconstruction. You can obtain scores for your Set A and B reconstructions at any time during the Challenge. Set C is the &quot;final examination&quot;, and although you have until September to study it, you will not be able to obtain intermediate scores. &quot;Tuning&quot; your methods to Set C will not be possible, so learn what you can from Sets A and B and then apply it to Set C.</p>\n\n<h3>Final scores and Challenge awards</h3>\n\n<p>Aggregate and individual scores for Set C records will be calculated based on reconstructions submitted no later than noon GMT on 1 September 2010. These scores, which will appear on your page when they have been calculated, determine the final ranking of participants.</p>\n\n<p>During a plenary session of Computing in Cardiology in September, four awards will be presented to the eligible participants in attendance with the best final scores as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>(Event 1, open source) Highest <em><strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong></em> score for an <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2010/#open-source-entry\">open source entry</a></li>\n\t<li>(Event 1, overall) Highest <em><strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong></em> score</li>\n\t<li>(Event 2, open source) Highest <em><strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong></em> score for an open-source entry</li>\n\t<li>(Event 2, overall) Highest <em><strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong></em> score</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Participants may enter one or both events, and open source entries are eligible for the overall awards as well as for the open source awards. If the best results in any category are achieved by two or more entries, the first of these entries to be submitted will receive the award in that category.</p>\n\n<h3>Entering the Open Source Division</h3>\n\n<p>As in previous years, the Challenge includes an open source division. You may enter the open source division by sending the source code for your challenge entry by email, before noon GMT on Wednesday, 1 September 2010, to <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=Challenge 2010 entrysource\">PhysioNet</a>. Use the subject line &quot;Challenge 2010 entry source&quot;, and be sure to include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Your name and email address</li>\n\t<li>All sources needed to produce a working version of your software (except for readily available standard libraries and header files)</li>\n\t<li>A note describing how to produce a working version of your software (a commented Makefile is ideal), and how to run your software</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each source file submitted should begin with a comment block containing the names of its authors and a reference to the open source license you have chosen for it, if any; for example:</p>\n\n<pre>     /* fill.c - fill signal gaps using large wads of duct tape\n        Copyright (C) 2010  Herman Foobar &lt;hbar@uncertain.org&gt;\n        This software is released under the terms of the GNU General\n        Public License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).\n     */\n</pre>\n\n<p>Source files in C, C++, Fortran, or Matlab m-code are preferred; other languages may be acceptable, but please ask first. Do not submit any code that cannot be freely redistributed. Following the conclusion of the Challenge, selected entries will be posted, with full credit to their authors, on PhysioNet.</p>\n\n<h3>Questions and answers about the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Must there be an automatic process to choose the set of signals used in the reconstruction of the target signal or is it acceptable that the choice of signals is not done by a program but by the participant?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Either method is acceptable. Keep in mind that the final rankings will be determined by your scores on set C, and that you will receive only one score for each of the set C records (in other words, you will not be able to try several different signal subsets for each set C record and choose the subset that yields the best score in each case).</p>\n\n<p><strong>There are some files in the challenge dataset, where there are several signals with zeros in the last 30 seconds. The determination of the target signal is ambiguous at the following signals: c21, c54, c67. What should be the way of handling this problem?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In each of these cases, there is only one signal that becomes flat (all zero values) after 9 minutes and 30 seconds (i.e., beginning at sample 71250).

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the number one cause of death worldwide. Of these deaths, 82% take place in low- and middle-income countries. Given their computing power and pervasiveness, is it possible for mobile phones to aid in delivery of quality health care, particularly to rural populations distant from physicians with the expertise needed to diagnose CVD?</p>\n\n<p>Advances in mobile phone technology have resulted in global availability of portable computing devices capable of performing many of the functions traditionally requiring desktop and larger computers. In addition to their technological features, mobile phones have a large cultural impact. They are user-friendly and are among the most efficient and most widely used means of communication. Currently there is about one cell phone for every two humans in the world.</p>\n\n<p>India is experiencing a double burden of disease with persistent infectious disease coupled with increasing incidence of chronic disease. Two chronic diseases, CVD and cancer, currently account for nearly 20% of the total disease burden, which is expected to double to 40% by 2016. Unfortunately, due to a lack of adequate primary care capacity, most chronic diseases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, when the cost of treatment and rehabilitation is prohibitive for the masses, particularly the poor. This is true for other middle-income developing countries such as Brazil, China, Indonesia and South Africa as well.</p>\n\n<p>India&#39;s large population spread, in conjunction with the increase in heart-related diseases, is a public health concern that has led to a joint collaboration between Narayana Hrudayalaya (one of India&rsquo;s leading health-care providers) and Sana (an open-source, student-managed, mobile telemedicine group at MIT; see <a href=\"http://www.sanamobile.org/\">http://www.sanamobile.org/</a>). Sana&#39;s specific objective in this venture is to enable an inexperienced nurse or paramedic to collect and transmit electrocardiograms (ECGs) from rural patients for remote analysis by cardiologists at a city hospital. While Sana has been successful in developing open-source software for transmitting and archiving ECGs through Bluetooth recording, significant obstacles still remain. PhysioNet has partnered with Sana to identify some of the crucial obstacles involved in having an inexperienced person record ECGs usable for diagnostic interpretation from a mobile device.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2011 is to develop an efficient algorithm able to run in near real-time within a mobile phone, that can provide useful feedback to a layperson in the process of acquiring a diagnostically useful ECG recording. At a minimum, the software should be able to indicate within a few seconds, while the patient is still present, if the ECG is of adequate quality for interpretation, or if another recording should be made. Ideally, the software should identify common problems (such as misplaced electrodes, poor skin-electrode contact, external electrical interference, and artifact resulting from patient motion) and either compensate for these deficiencies or provide guidance for correcting them.</p>\n\n<p>Data to support development and evaluation of challenge entries are being collected by the Sana project, and will be provided freely via PhysioNet. The data set will include ten-second recordings of twelve-lead ECGs; age, sex, weight, and possibly other relevant information about the patients; and (for some patients) a photo of the electrode placement taken using the mobile phone. Although some of the recordings will be identified initially as acceptable or unacceptable, challenge participants and others interested will have an opportunity to assist in establishing a &quot;gold standard&quot; classification of the quality of the recordings in the challenge data set.</p>\n\n<p>Participants may enter the challenge by completing the classification task described below. Awards will be given to the most successful participants who attend Computing in Cardiology 2011 (18-21 September 2011 in Hangzhou, China) to present their work and discuss their findings with other participants and CinC attendees; see Awards below for details.</p>\n\n<p>Data for the Challenge</p>\n\n<p>The challenge data are standard 12-lead ECG recordings (leads I, II, II, aVR, aVL,aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6) with full diagnostic bandwidth (0.05 through 100 Hz). The leads are recorded simultaneously for a minimum of 10 seconds; each lead is sampled at 500 Hz with 16-bit resolution.</p>\n\n<p>Nurses, technicians, and volunteers with varying amounts of training recorded the ECGs for this project. In the intended application, the recordists (those making ECG recordings) will not necessarily have had experience. Since the goal of this challenge is to investigate if laypersons can be assisted via software in collecting high-quality ECGs reliably, the recordings gathered for this challenge include ECGs made by volunteers with minimal training.</p>\n\n<p>Data for the Challenge are available <a href=\"/content/challenge-2011-db/\">here</a>. To download them efficiently, use rsync as described <a href=\"https://physionet.org/faq.shtml#downloading-databases\">here</a> (retrieve the challenge-2011 &quot;module&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>The data are provided in both CSV format, compatible with the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2011/api/\">Challenge Android API</a>, as well as standard PhysioBank (compact binary) formats, readable using the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB software package</a> and the PhysioBank <a href=\"http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/ATM\">ATM</a> (which can convert them to tab-separated text, Matlab, or EDF formats).</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Datasets</h3>\n\n<p>Three challenge data sets have been created from the collected ECGs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Set A: training data, with reference quality assessments provided to the participants (<em>available now</em>)</li>\n\t<li>Set B: test data for events 1 and 2, with reference quality assessments withheld; (<em>available now</em>)</li>\n\t<li>Set C: test data for event 3 (not released to participants)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A series of events prevented us from collecting a sufficient number of ECGs with the hardware we had originally planned to use for this Challenge, and in order to permit the Challenge to go forward, the ECGs in sets A, B, and C have been collected using conventional ECG machines. (A pilot dataset containing synthetic ECGs recorded using the target hardware was posted previously and is still available.) Our originally planned data acquisition process is continuing, and we expect to have a set of ECGs acquired using that process available soon. As soon as possible, we&#39;ll assemble a set D of these ECGs, we&#39;ll develop a set of reference classifications for them, and we will classify them using the entries for events 2 and 3 as well. We will share the results of this experiment with event 2 and 3 participants, and we will post set D as a supplement to the Challenge 2011 data sets on PhysioNet. Since participants have not had an opportunity to study samples of ECGs collected using this process, however, these results will not be used for scoring any of the Challenge events.</p>\n\n<h3>ECG Quality Assessment</h3>\n\n<p>ECGs collected for the challenge were reviewed by a group of annotators with varying amounts of expertise in ECG analysis, in blinded fashion for grading and interpretation. Between 3 and 18 annotators, working independently, examined each ECG, assigning it a letter grade (A (0.95): excellent, B (0.85): good, C (0.75): adequate, D (0.60): poor, or F (0): unacceptable) for signal quality. The average grade was calculated in each case, and each record was assigned to one of 3 groups:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Group 1 (acceptable): If the average grade is 0.70 or more, and at most one grade is F.</li>\n\t<li>Group 2 (indeterminate): If the average grade is 0.70 or more, but two or more grades were F.</li>\n\t<li>Group 3 (unacceptable): If the average grade is less than 0.70.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Approximately 70% of the collected records were assigned to group 1, 30% to group 3, and fewer than 1% to group 2, reflecting a high degree of agreement among the annotators.</p>\n\n<p>Challenge participants also have an opportunity to grade the ECGs in the challenge data sets for quality control purposes. Login to PhysioNetWorks (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/pnw/login\">create an account</a> first if you don&#39;t have one already) and follow the link from your PhysioNetWorks home page to &quot;Diagnostic ECG Annotations&quot; to get started. An award fund of US$2000 will be divided among participants who have contributed in this way.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Events and Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>ECGs from all three quality groups will be presented to the challenge participants in blinded fashion. Participants may enter one or more of the following challenge events:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Event 1: (closed source, open data) Participants must submit classifications of the challenge test set recordings only. The score is the fraction of group 1 and group 3 ECGs in set B that are correctly classified by the participant&#39;s algorithm.</li>\n\t<li>Event 2: (open source, open data) Participants must submit Java software for performing the classification function compatible with a template API and Android phone emulator provided by the challenge organizers. The score is the fraction of group 1 and group 3 ECGs in set B that are correctly classified by the participant&#39;s algorithm.</li>\n\t<li>Event 3: (open source, closed data) Same as event 2, but using set C and a different scoring algorithm. The score is the product of classification accuracy (as in events 1 and 2) and a function of execution time in the reference Android phone (faster is better).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>How to submit an entry</h3>\n\n<p><strong>The final deadline for entries has now passed; the information in this section is for reference only.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>To enter any of the three Challenge events, login to PhysioNetWorks (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/pnw/login\">create an account</a> first if you don&#39;t have one already) and follow the link from your PhysioNetWorks home page to &quot;PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2011&quot; to get started</strong>. Joining the project creates a Challenge Participant Page for you, where you will submit your entries and receive your scores.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions for submitting entries to event 1 are on your Challenge Participant Page.</strong> Participants may submit up to five entries in event 1, at any time until the final deadline of noon GMT on Friday, 5 August 2011; their highest-scoring entry will determine their ranking in event 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Events 2 and 3 are open to event 1 participants who qualified by submitting an event 1 entry no later than noon GMT on Saturday, 30 April 2011. A single submission enters both events 2 and 3. Instructions for preparing an event 2 and 3 entry are <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2011/api/\">here</a>.</strong> Participants may resubmit their event 2 and 3 entry as many times as they wish until the final deadline of noon GMT on Friday, 5 August 2011, <em>but only the final submission received before the deadline will be scored</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In events 2 and 3, challenge participants are required to develop algorithms capable of running in a reference Android phone. An <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2011/api/\">API including a working sample algorithm</a> is provided as a framework for these algorithms. <em><strong>To participate in events 2 and 3 you must use this API.</strong></em> In events 2 and 3, each open-source algorithm that can run in an Android phone will be tested in a reference phone.</p>\n\n<p>Algorithms are not required to produce a classification for each record, but only correct classifications contribute to the scores (thus a missing classification is equivalent to an incorrect classification).</p>\n\n<p>Note that although a few group 2 ECGs are present in the challenge data sets, they do not influence participants&#39; scores. Given that the expert annotators disagree about their acceptability, it is unreasonable to expect participants&#39; algorithms to classify them in any specific way, so group 2 ECGs are not counted. Nevertheless, since participants are not told which records belong to group 2, participants can improve their chances of obtaining a high score by classifying all records.</p>\n\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n\n<p>A generous donation from the <a href=\"http://www.gsmworld.com/about-us/\">GSM Association</a>, in addition to support from <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computing in Cardiology</a>, has allowed us to increase Challenge awards this year to amounts that will offset most or all of the costs of registration, accommodation and travel to CinC 2011.</p>\n\n<p>The GSMA represents the interests of the worldwide mobile communications industry. Spanning 219 countries, the GSMA unites nearly 800 of the world&rsquo;s mobile operators, as well as more than 200 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem, including handset makers, software companies, equipment providers, Internet companies, and media and entertainment organisations. The GSMA is focused on innovating, incubating and creating new opportunities for its membership, all with the end goal of driving the growth of the mobile communications industry.</p>\n\n<p>To be eligible for one of the major awards, you must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Submit a preliminary entry in event 1 no later than noon GMT on Saturday, 30 April 2011.</li>\n\t<li>Submit an acceptable abstract (about 300 words) about your work on the Challenge to CinC no later than noon GMT on Sunday, 1 May 2011.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a final entry in at least one event no later than noon GMT on Friday, 5 August 2011.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a paper (4 pages) describing your work on the Challenge no later than noon GMT on Sunday, 11 September 2011.</li>\n\t<li>Attend CinC 2011 and discuss your work. All Challenge presentations are scheduled for Tuesday, 20 September. Challenge awards will be presented during the closing plenary session on Wednesday, 21 September.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each of the three most successful eligible participant teams, including the winners of each of the three events, will receive an award of US$2000, but no team or individual will receive more than one such award. If an eligible team achieves top results in more than one event, they will receive one award, and the other award(s) will be distributed to the next most successful team(s). Our objective is to ensure that at least three of the best entries are represented and discussed at CinC. An additional US$2000 will be divided among other participants who have contributed to the development of the data used in the challenge.</p>\n\n<p>We thank the GSMA and Computing in Cardiology for their support of this year&#39;s Challenge.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Results</h3>\n\n<p>Following the final deadline for submission of entries on 5 August 2011, here are the final scores for the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Event 1 (closed source, open data set B)</strong></p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Participant</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Score</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Xiaopeng Zhao</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.932</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Gari Clifford</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.926</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>CT Ho</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.920</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Dieter Hayn</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.916</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Gabriel Garcia</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.912</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Nir Kalkstein</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.912</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Irena Jekova</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.908</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Sebastian Zaunseder</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.904</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Kai Noponen</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.900</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Benjamin Moody</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0.896</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The top 10 (of 49) participants in event 1 are listed above.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>The development of methods for prediction of mortality rates in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) populations has been motivated primarily by the need to compare the efficacy of medications, care guidelines, surgery, and other interventions when, as is common, it is necessary to control for differences in severity of illness or trauma, age, and other factors. For example, comparing overall mortality rates between trauma units in a community hospital, a teaching hospital, and a military field hospital is likely to reflect the differences in the patient populations more than any differences in standards of care. Acuity scores such as APACHE and SAPS-II are widely used to account for these differences in the context of such studies.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, the focus of the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2012 is to develop methods for patient-specific prediction of in-hospital mortality. Participants will use information collected during the first two days of an ICU stay to predict which patients survive their hospitalizations, and which patients do not.</p>\n\n<h3>Data for the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>The data used for the challenge consist of records from 12,000 ICU stays. All patients were adults who were admitted for a wide variety of reasons to cardiac, medical, surgical, and trauma ICUs. ICU stays of less than 48 hours have been excluded. Patients with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate\">DNR</a> (do not resuscitate) or CMO (comfort measures only) directives were not excluded.</p>\n\n<p>Four thousand records comprise <em>training set A</em>, and the remaining records form <em>test sets B and C</em>. Outcomes are provided for the training set records, and are withheld for the test set records.</p>\n\n<p>Up to 42 variables were recorded at least once during the first 48 hours after admission to the ICU. Not all variables are available in all cases, however. Six of these variables are <em>general descriptors</em> (collected on admission), and the remainder are <em>time series</em>, for which multiple observations may be available.</p>\n\n<p>Each observation has an associated <em>time-stamp</em> indicating the elapsed time of the observation since ICU admission in each case, in hours and minutes. Thus, for example, a time stamp of 35:19 means that the associated observation was made 35 hours and 19 minutes after the patient was admitted to the ICU.</p>\n\n<p>Each record is stored as a comma-separated value (CSV) text file. To simplify downloading, participants may download a zip file or tarball containing all of training set A or test set B. Test set C will be used for validation only and will not be made available to participants.</p>\n\n<p><a>&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Update (8 May 2012):</em> The extraneous ages that were present in the previous versions of some data files have been removed, and a new general descriptor (<em>ICUType</em>, see below) has been added in each data file.</p>\n\n<p>Five additional <em>outcome-related descriptors</em>, described below, are known for each record.

order within each record, and the associated time stamps indicate the elapsed time since admission to the ICU. Measurements may be recorded at regular intervals ranging from hourly to daily, or at irregular intervals as required. Not all time series are available in all cases.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2012/#weight\">In a few cases, such as blood pressure, different measurements made using two or more methods or sensors may be recorded with the same or only slightly different time-stamps. Occasional outliers should be expected as well. </a></p>\n\n<p><a>&nbsp;<sup>*</sup></a> Note that <em>Weight</em> is both a general descriptor (recorded on admission) and a time series variable (often measured hourly, for estimating fluid balance).</p>\n\n<h3>Outcome-related Descriptors</h3>\n\n<p>The outcome-related descriptors are kept in a separate CSV text file for each of the three record sets; as noted, only the file associated with training set A is available to participants. Each line of the outcomes file contains these descriptors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>RecordID</em> (defined as above)</li>\n\t<li><em>SAPS-I score</em> (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6499483\">Le Gall et al., 1984</a>)</li>\n\t<li><em>SOFA score</em> (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11594901\">Ferreira et al., 2001</a>)</li>\n\t<li><em>Length of stay</em> (days)</li>\n\t<li><em>Survival</em> (days)</li>\n\t<li><em>In-hospital death</em> (0: survivor, or 1: died in-hospital)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <em>Length of stay</em> is the number of days between the patient&#39;s admission to the ICU and the end of hospitalization (including any time spent in the hospital after discharge from the ICU). If the patient&#39;s death was recorded (in or out of hospital), then <em>Survival</em> is the number of days between ICU admission and death; otherwise, <em>Survival</em> is assigned the value -1. Since patients who spent less than 48 hours in the ICU have been excluded, <em>Length of stay</em> and <em>Survival</em> never have the values 0 or 1 in the challenge data sets. Given these definitions and constraints,</p>\n\n<p><em>Survival</em> &gt; <em>Length of stay</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survivor<br>\n<em>Survival</em> = -1&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survivor<br>\n2 &le; <em>Survival</em> &le; <em>Length of stay</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-hospital death</p>\n\n<h3>Entering the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>To begin, we recommend studying the training set as preparation for the Challenge itself. In particular, note that the SAPS-I score can be calculated readily from the time series, as the sample entries below do. To succeed in the Challenge, you should aim to outperform the sample entries (see Software below).</p>\n\n<p>All entries in the Challenge must be in the form of source code that analyses a single Challenge record, producing a prediction (0: survival, or 1: in-hospital death) and an estimate of the risk of death (as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is certain survival and 1 is certain death).</p>\n\n<p>Your entry may be written in portable (ANSI/ISO) C or MATLAB/Octave m-code; other languages, such as Java, Perl, and R, may be acceptable (see <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2012/#other-languages\">special requirements for entries in other languages</a> below), but please ask us first, and do so no later than <strong>7 April 2012</strong>. Entries must accept properly-formatted input and produce properly-formatted output, either as <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2012/physionet2012.m\">physionet2012.m</a> does (if written in m-code), or as <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2012/physionet2012.c\">physionet2012.c</a> does (otherwise).</p>\n\n<p>Acceptable entries are evaluated and scored by PhysioNet using an automated test framework, two versions of which are also available to participants for testing their entries unofficially prior to submitting them. The framework starts execution of an entry, supplies data from a single Challenge record, and collects the entry&#39;s analysis for that record; this process is a &quot;run&quot;. The framework performs a separate run for each of the 4000 records in set B or set C.</p>\n\n<p><em>Entries will be restarted for each run (each test record); they may not store information for use in later runs (for example, by writing files to be read later, or, in MATLAB entries, by setting global variables). Entries may include files that may be read but not modified during the test.</em></p>\n\n<p>Awards will be presented to the most successful eligible participants during <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computing in Cardiology</a> (CinC) 2012. To be eligible for an award, you must:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Join <a href=\"https://physionet.org/users/\">PhysioNetWorks</a> if you are not already a member, and follow the link from your PhysioNetWorks home page to &quot;PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2012&quot; to register as a particpant. Joining the project creates a Challenge Participant Page for you, where you will submit your entries and receive your scores.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a preliminary Challenge entry via PhysioNetWorks no later than <strong>25 April 2012</strong>. (The period before this deadline is Phase 1.) You may submit <strong>up to five Phase 1 entries</strong> before this deadline. (Use them or lose them!) Each entry will receive scores for set B.</li>\n\t<li>Submit an acceptable abstract on your work on the Challenge to <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computing in Cardiology</a> no later than <strong>1 May 2012</strong>. <em>Include a pair of set B scores for at least one preliminary entry in your abstract.</em> Please select &quot;PhysioNet/CinC Challenge&quot; as the topic of your abstract, so it can be identified easily by the abstract review committee.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a final Challenge entry via PhysioNetWorks during Phase 2 (on or after <strong>1 June</strong> but no later than <strong>25 August 2012</strong>). You may submit <strong>up to five Phase 2 entries</strong> between 26 April and 25 August. Each entry will receive scores for set B.</li>\n\t<li>Select one of your previously submitted Phase 1 or Phase 2 entries for testing using set C. If you have not made a choice before <strong>26 August 2012</strong>, we will test the entry that received the best event 1 score for set B. The set C scores will determine the final rankings of the entries, with the top-ranked entries in each event eligible for awards.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a full (4-page) paper on your work on the Challenge to CinC no later than <strong>1 September 2012</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Attend CinC 2012 (<strong>9-12 September 2012</strong>, in Krakow, Poland) and present your work there.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>An important goal of this Challenge, and of others in the annual series of PhysioNet/CinC Challenges, is to accelerate progress on the Challenge questions, not only during the limited period of the Challenge, but also afterward. In pursuit of this goal, we strongly encourage participants to submit open-source entries that will be made freely available after the conclusion of the Challenge via PhysioNet. If your entry is not intended as an open-source entry, please state this clearly within its first few lines.</p>\n\n<p>Eligible authors of the entries that receive the best set C scores in each Challenge event will receive award certificates during the closing plenary session of CinC on 12 September 2012. In recognition of their contributions to further work on the Challenge problem, eligible authors of the open-source entries that receive the best set C scores will also receive monetary awards. No team or individual will receive more than one such monetary award. <a>&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n<h3>Sample entries, test frameworks, and sample results</h3>\n\n<p>We have provided sample entries written in MATLAB m-code and in C, test frameworks that can be used for batch-processing a set of Challenge data using a sample entry or your own entry, code for calculating unofficial scores, as well as the outputs of the sample entries for set A. Use this software to test your entry before submitting it, to verify that it can accept properly-formatted input and produce properly-formatted output. If you wish, you may incorporate code from the sample entries within your own entry, but you will have to add something of your own creation in order to succeed in the Challenge!</p>\n\n<p>Participants may find the MATLAB and C functions for calculating SAPS-I scores to be useful. The calculated SAPS scores do not always match those given in the outcomes file, however. <a>&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>For participants developing entries using MATLAB:</strong></p>\n\n<p>A valid entry written in m-code must be a function named physionet2012, with this signature:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>[risk,prediction]=physionet2012(time,param,value)\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The function must be able to run this way within the test framework, genresults.m (below), on a 64-bit GNU/Linux platform running MATLAB R2010b (or a later version).

We define the numbers of true positives (<strong>TP</strong>), false positives (<strong>FP</strong>), false negatives (<strong>FN</strong>), and true negatives (<strong>TN</strong>) as below:</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Outcome</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\"><em>Observed</em></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Death</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Survivor</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Predicted</em></td>\n\t\t\t<td>Death</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>TP</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>FP</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Survivor</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>FN</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>TN</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Using these definitions, the 2 metrics and the scoring for Event 1 are given by:</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Se = TP / (TP + FN)</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>[the fraction of in-hospital deaths that are predicted]</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong><sup>+</sup>P = TP / (TP + FP)</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>[the fraction of correct predictions of in-hospital deaths]</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Score1 = min(Se,<sup>+</sup>P)</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>[the minimum of Sensitivity and positive predictivity]</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The sample MATLAB entry based on SAPS-1 earns an unofficial Event 1 score of 0.296 on set A, whereas random guessing yields a score of 0.139. A perfect (and almost certainly unattainable) Event 1 score is 1, so there is much room for improvement on the sample entry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scoring for Event 2</strong> is based on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosmer%E2%80%93Lemeshow_test\">Hosmer-Lemeshow H statistic</a> (a common measure of model calibration), and on the spread, D, of risk estimates.</p>\n\n<p>To calculate the H statistic for a given entry, the in-hospital mortality risks predicted by that entry are first sorted and the corresponding records are binned into deciles designated by <em>g = 1,2,3...10</em>. Thus the first decile (<em>g = 1</em>) of the 4000-record set B contains the 400 records with the lowest predicted risk, the second decile contains the next 400 records, etc. The H statistic is then calculated as:</p>\n\n<p>where for each decile <em>g</em>, <em>O<sub>g</sub></em> is the observed number of in-hospital deaths, <em>E<sub>g</sub></em> is the predicted number of deaths, <em>N<sub>g</sub></em> is the number of records (400), and <em>&pi;<sub>g</sub></em> is the mean estimated risk for records in the decile. This definition is modified as shown with respect to the standard definition of H by the addition of 0.001 in the denominator; we do this to avoid division by zero if <em>&pi;<sub>g</sub></em> is zero or one. This can occur if an entry estimates a risk of zero (or one) for 400 or more records in a set; the effect of doing so, regardless of accuracy, will cause a substantial increase in H (lower values are better), so we strongly recommend <em>not</em> allowing your entry to output risk values below about 0.01 or above about 0.99.</p>\n\n<p>To be useful as input to medical decisions for individual patients, risk estimates should accurately reflect individual patient risks, rather than simply the risk for the entire population of patients. For this reason, the event 2 score is also based on the range of risks, specifically on the difference, D, between the mean risk estimates in the top and bottom deciles from the H calculation (<em>&pi;<sub>10</sub>-&pi;<sub>1</sub></em>). The event 2 score is thus the <em>range-normalized H statistic</em>, defined as <strong><em>H/D</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Files <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2012/lemeshow.m\">lemeshow.m</a> (in Octave/MATLAB m-code) and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2012/score.c\">score.c</a> (in C) define functions that calculate <strong><em>H/D</em></strong> as defined above.</p>\n\n<p>The sample MATLAB entry based on SAPS-1 achieves an unofficial Event 2 score of 68 on set A, and random guessing scores 9666. As for Event 1, an ideal score (0 in this case) is almost certainly unattainable, but it should be possible to improve on the sample entry. The figure below shows the observed and predicted numbers of deaths for each decile of risk assigned by the sample MATLAB entry for set A.</p>\n\n<h3>Frequently asked questions about the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Can I submit an entry written in ...?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We would really like to say yes! What will determine our answer is whether it is practical and reasonably efficient for us to evaluate your entry, and you can help us by testing and documenting the procedure needed to do so thoroughly.</p>\n\n<p>If you can show us how to run your entry in an unmodified copy of our <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2012/genresults.sh\">test framework for entries written in C</a>, using only compilers, interpreters, libraries, and other standard components that are freely available for GNU/Linux, we encourage you to submit code written in the language of your choice. We will accept entries written in Java, Perl, or R under these conditions, and (if you ask nicely) we will consider adding other languages to this short list.</p>\n\n<p>Please give us as much extra time as possible to review entries not written in C or m-code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would it still be possible to participate if we send you code that is compiled and tested to run on the destination hardware and OS?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sorry, no. We do not require participants to submit open-source entries, but we will not test executables that we have not compiled ourselves from source code that we have inspected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If I don&#39;t submit all 5 preliminary (Phase 1) entries, can I add the unused ones to my quota of 5 Phase 2 entries?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No. We are trying to encourage both experimentation with multiple approaches and sustained effort. In past Challenges some participants have used their entire allowance of entries before the first deadline, and others have saved their entries until hours before the final deadline. The most successful participants have usually reflected on each set of results, refining their ideas (and not merely their decision thresholds) before submitting the next entry. This approach yields better results, and it also allows us to review your entries and provide scores more rapidly than if we receive a large fraction of them just before the deadlines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will it be possible to outperform the sample entries based on SAPS-I?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, certainly. SAPS-I uses fewer than half of the variables provided in the Challenge data sets, and only the first half (24 of 48 hours) of those. There is plenty of room for improvement in both events.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are the scores for the C and m-code sample entries different?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The scores are different because the two sample entries are not exactly the same algorithm. The SAPS calculations are very similar, but the C version makes use of data with time stamp of &#39;24:00&#39; (i.e., exactly 24 hours from the start) and the m-code version stops at &#39;23:59&#39;. This accounts for the very slight difference in the event 1 scores even though both entries use the same decision threshold. The risk estimates (which determine the event 2 scores) are completely different; the m-code entry uses a function that was fitted to the observed distribution of risk in set A, and the C entry uses a lookup table that is not optimized at all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why didn&#39;t you choose [my favorite statistic] as a scoring metric?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fund another award and we will consider adding another event!</p>\n\n<p>No single measure can summarize all of the important aspects of performance on the Challenge problem in a single number; that&#39;s why we have multiple events. Since scoring metrics inevitably influence how participants design and refine their entries, we have chosen metrics that provide incentives to make <em>useful</em> predictions. Many alternatives would reward trivial and clinically irrelevant strategies; for example, one can obtain a high overall accuracy by predicting that all patients will survive, but such a predictor is of no value whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the precise deadline for Phase 1? What happens if I can&#39;t figure out how to submit a valid entry by then?</strong></p>\n\n<p>On the off-chance that someone on Baker or Howard Islands in the mid-Pacific, or on a ship at sea between longitudes 172.5&deg; W and 180&deg;, submits an entry just before midnight local time on 25 April, and in order to be fair to everyone else, the deadline for phase 1 was noon GMT on 26 April; at that time, the software that collects entries stopped doing so.</p>\n\n<p>The deadline is one of several that are important if you would like to be eligible for the Challenge awards (see <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2012/#rules-and-dates\">above</a>). Anyone who wishes to participate without eligibility for awards is welcome to join in unofficially during Phase 2 (1 June through 25 August).</p>\n\n<h3>Suggested readings on acuity scores and mortality prediction</h3>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt>APACHE (1981)</dt>\n\t<dd>Knaus WA, Zimmerman JE, Wagner DP, Draper EA, Lawrence DE. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7261642\"> APACHE - acute physiology and chronic health evaluation: A physiologically based classification system</a>. <em>Critical Care Medicine</em> <strong>9</strong>(8):591-597 (1981 Aug).</dd>\n\t<dt>SAPS-I (1984)</dt>\n\t<dd>Le Gall JR, Loirat P, Alperovitch A, Glaser P, Granthil C, Mathieu D, Mercier P, Thomas R, Villers D. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6499483\"> A simplified acute physiology score for ICU patients</a>. <em>Critical Care Medicine</em> <strong>12</strong>(11):975-977 (1984 Nov).</dd>\n\t<dt>MPM-I (1985)</dt>\n\t<dd>Lemeshow S, Teres D, Pastides H, Avrunin JS, Steingrub JS. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4006490\"> A method for predicting survival and mortality of ICU patients using objectively derived weights</a>. <em>Critical Care Medicine</em> <strong>13</strong>(7):519-525 (1985 Jul).</dd>\n\t<dt>APACHE II (1985)</dt>\n\t<dd>Knaus WA, Draper EA, Wagner DP, Zimmerman JE. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3928249\"> APACHE II: a severity of disease classification system</a>. <em>Critical Care Medicine</em> <strong>13</strong>(10):818-29 (1985 Oct).</dd>\n\t<dt>APACHE III (1991)</dt>\n\t<dd>Knaus WA, Wagner DP, Draper EA, Zimmerman JE, Bergner M, Bastos PG, Sirio CA, Murphy DJ, Lotring T, Damiano A, et al. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1959406\"> The APACHE III prognostic system.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>Since the late 19th century, decelerations of fetal heart rate have been known to be associated with fetal distress. Intermittent observations of fetal heart sounds (auscultation) became standard clinical practice by the mid-20th century. The first fetal heart rate (FHR) monitors were developed more than 50 years ago, and became widely available by the mid-1970s. Continuous FHR monitoring was expected to result in dramatic reduction of undiagnosed fetal hypoxia, but disillusionment rapidly set in as studies showed that the outputs of FHR monitors were often unreliable and difficult to interpret, resulting in increased rates of Caesarean deliveries of healthy infants, with little evidence that reductions in adverse outcomes were attributable to the use of FHR monitors (see <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2013/#fhr-history\">FHR History</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Improved accuracy in FHR estimation has been achieved through use of more sophisticated signal processing techniques applied to more reliable signals. These improvements, coupled with a better understanding of the limitations of fetal monitoring, have led to wider acceptance. There remains a great deal of room for improvement, however. The most accurate method for measuring FHR is direct fetal electrocardiographic (FECG) monitoring using a fetal scalp electrode. This is possible only in labor, however, and is not common in current clinical practice because of its associated risks.</p>\n\n<p>Noninvasive FECG monitoring makes use of electrodes placed on the mother&#39;s abdomen. This method can be used throughout the second half of pregnancy and is of negligible risk, but it is often difficult to detect the fetal QRS complexes in ECG signals obtained in this way, since the maternal ECG is usually of greater amplitude in them.</p>\n\n<div>\n<div><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Four simultaneous noninvasive fetal ECG signals, acquired using electrodes placed on the mother&#39;s abdomen, containing both the fetal and the maternal ECGs.. The maternal QRS complexes (not marked) are larger than the fetal QRS complexes (marked in blue). The figure is interactive; click on the large blue circle to remove and restore the marker bars. Click on the Help tab for information about other options.</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Other features of the direct fetal ECG, such as FHR variability and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2013/#fqti\">fetal QT interval</a>, may be useful independent indicators of fetal status. There are no accepted techniques for assessing such features from noninvasive FECG, however. Before such techniques can be developed, it will be necessary to establish accurate methods for locating QRS complexes and for estimating the QT interval in noninvasive FECG.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this year&#39;s PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge is to encourage development of accurate algorithms for locating QRS complexes and estimating the QT interval in noninvasive FECG signals. Using carefully reviewed reference QRS annotations and QT intervals as a gold standard, based on simultaneous direct FECG when possible, the challenge is designed to measure and compare the performance of participants&#39; algorithms objectively. Multiple challenge events are designed to test basic FHR estimation accuracy, as well as accuracy in measurement of inter-beat (RR) and QT intervals needed as a basis for derivation of other FECG features.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Data Sets</h3>\n\n<p>Data for the challenge consist of a collection of one-minute fetal ECG recordings. Each recording includes four noninvasive abdominal signals as illustrated above (figure 1). The data were obtained from multiple sources using a variety of instrumentation with differing frequency response, resolution, and configuration, although in all cases they are presented as 1000 samples per signal per second.</p>\n\n<p>In each case, reference annotations marking the locations of each fetal QRS complex were produced, usually with reference to a direct FECG signal, acquired from a fetal scalp electrode. The direct signals are not included in the challenge data sets, however.</p>\n\n<p>As in recent challenges, the data have been divided into three sets:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Learning (training) set A</strong>: includes noninvasive fetal ECG signals, as well as the reference annotations for them (for participants&#39; use only; not used to score or rank challenge entries)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Open test set B</strong>: noninvasive signals only (reference annotations withheld; for evaluation of challenge entries in events 4, 5, and 6)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hidden test set C</strong>: unpublished records (reserved for evaluation of open-source challenge entries in events 1, 2, and 3)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that the training data set (set A) does not include examples of all of the sources included in the test sets. It will be necessary to design methods for addressing the challenge that are sufficiently flexible to work with data that have recording characteristics that are similar, but not identical, to those in the training set. This feature of the challenge data is intended to encourage participants to develop approaches that are compatible with the variety of devices and signals encountered in clinical practice, and to allow us to assess how successfully participants have been able to accomplish this goal.</p>\n\n<p>Explore <a href=\"http://physionet.org/lightwave?db=challenge/2013/set-a\">training set A</a> and <a href=\"http://physionet.org/lightwave?db=challenge/2013/set-b\">test set B</a> using LightWAVE, our new waveform and annotation viewer.

The PhysioBank-compatible files are available individually at <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2013/set-a\">/physiobank/database/challenge/2013/set-a</a> and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2013/set-b\">/physiobank/database/challenge/2013/set-b</a>. All five versions contain the same data.</p>\n\n<p>Reference QT interval measurements are in preparation; those for records in set A will be made available to participants when they are complete.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge is to produce a set of annotations and a QT interval measurement that matches the hidden references as nearly as possible, for each record in set B or C.</p>\n\n<h3>Reference annotations, heart rates, and RR and QT intervals</h3>\n\n<p>Using the direct FECG when possible, reference annotations marking the locations of the fetal QRS complexes (denoted by <strong>N</strong>) have been derived by crowd-sourcing using a mixture of experts, volunteers, and algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>These reference annotations have been processed to derive the <em>reference RR interval time series</em> (the intervals between successive <strong>N</strong> annotations).</p>\n\n<p>The reference RR interval time series have been processed further to derive the <em>reference heart rate (HR)</em> time series. Each HR measurement is determined by a widely-used <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2013/#ipfm\">IPFM</a>-based method over a 6-second window (i.e., by the number of reference RR intervals falling within a 6-second interval, including fractional intervals that fall only partly within the interval). Successive windows overlap by 50% (3 seconds), but the first and last windows in each one-minute record are omitted (since the lengths of the initial and final RR interval in the record are unknown), and any windows that include a gap in the RR interval series are likewise omitted. Thus there are at most 16 HR measurements per one-minute record.</p>\n\n<p>A single <em>reference QT interval measurement</em> is produced for each record for which the direct ECG is available. Using the reference QRS annotations to time-align the direct fetal ECG waveforms, the median fetal cardiac cycle is computed, and the reference QT interval is measured manually by inspection of the median cycle. The software used to compute the median cycle is available in source form to participants.</p>\n\n<h3>Test annotations, heart rates, RR and QT intervals</h3>\n\n<p>Participants create software that annotates a challenge record with reference to the noninvasive ECG signals only. <em>Important: Software created for the challenge should annotate only one record and then exit.</em> In the challenge, it should not be assumed that any other records are available for reference at run-time.</p>\n\n<p>An entry must produce a <em>test annotation file</em> for any record presented to it, in the same format as the reference annotation files. (Either the PhysioBank-compatible binary format, as in the *.fqrs files provided for set A, or the text format, as in the *.fqrs.txt files for set A, is acceptable.) The challenge organizers will derive <em>test RR and HR time series</em> from the test annotation files, using the same software that was used to derive the reference RR and HR time series. This software is available for participants&#39; use in development and self-evaluation of their challenge entries.</p>\n\n<p>Optionally, participants&#39; algorithms may compute a <em>test QT interval measurement</em> for each record, and append that measurement to the test annotation file as shown in the example. It may be advantageous to make such a measurement using a method similar to that used for the reference QT interval measurements, but participants are free to use any method of their choice. Note that QT interval durations will vary among the four noninvasive signals; the challenge is to match (as closely as possible) the reference QT interval measured from the direct signal, which is not available except in the learning set. This will not be easy!</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Events and Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>This year&#39;s challenge is structured as three pairs of events. Events 1, 2, and 3 are the major events for which monetary awards will be given to the top-ranked participants; they require submission of open-source entries to be tested by the challenge organizers using test set C. Events 4, 5, and 6 are minor events in which the participants submit their entries&#39; annotation files for each record in test set B; non-monetary awards will be given to the top-ranked participants in these events.</p>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><strong>Events 1 and 4: Fetal heart rate measurement</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>In these events, the goal is to produce a set of <strong>N</strong> annotations that can be used to construct a test FHR time series that closely matches the reference FHR time series, for each recording in the test set. For each reference FHR measurement, a matching test FHR measurement is chosen. If there is no matching FHR measurement, an FHR of zero is used instead.\n\t<p>Scores in these events are computed from the differences between matching reference and test FHR measurements, calculated over the entire test set (C for event 1, B for event 4).</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Events 2 and 5: Fetal RR interval measurement</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>In these events, the goal is to produce a set of <strong>N</strong> annotations that can be used to construct a test RR interval time series that closely matches the reference RR interval time series, for each recording in the test set. For each reference RR interval, a matching test RR interval is chosen. Matching intervals must begin within 100 milliseconds of each other; if there is no matching test interval, an interval of zero is used instead.\n\t<p>Scores in these events are computed from the differences between matching reference and test RR intervals, calculated over the entire test set (C for event 2, B for event 5).</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt><strong>Event 3: Fetal QT interval measurement</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>In this event, the goal is to produce an estimate of the median QT interval for each recording in the test set.\n\t<p>Scores in this event are calculated from the differences between matching reference and test QT intervals, calculated over the test set C. Since direct ECG signals, hence reference QT intervals, are not available for all records in the test set, some records will not be scored. Entries should make test QT interval measurements for all records if their authors wish to participate in event 3, since we will not publish a list of records that will be scored for this event.</p>\n\n\t<p>We originally planned and announced an event 6 for QT interval measurement on test set B. This event has been cancelled. Reliable reference fetal QT measurements are available for only a subset of challenge records, and we planned to score events 3 and 6 using only these records. Since there were fewer such records than anticipated, it was necessary to allocate these records to sets A and C only; hence we are unable to score event 6 since there are no reliable means of determining reference QT intervals for the set B records.</p>\n\t</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Entering the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>To begin, we recommend studying the learning set as preparation for the Challenge itself. A sample entry that can be used as a model for your entries, and software for scoring your entries using the learning set, are available here (in preliminary versions, <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2013/physionet2013.m\">physionet2013.m</a> and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2013/genresults.m\">genresults.m</a>, for MATLAB). <em>Scores obtained from learning set data are not used for ranking entries, however!</em>&nbsp; We provide the scoring software so that participants can verify that they are able to prepare properly formatted entries. In general, participants should expect that official scores obtained using the test sets will differ from unofficial scores obtained using the learning set, especially if the algorithms have been (over)trained.</p>\n\n<p><strong>All entries</strong> must include (or be able to produce) annotation files in the format of the reference annotation files provided for set A.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open-source entries</strong> must include the sources for the software used to produce the annotations. As in the sample entries, your entry must write the annotations to standard output rather than to a file; our test framework captures the standard output of your entry for processing. Your entry may be written in portable (ANSI/ISO) C or MATLAB/Octave m-code; other languages, such as C++, Java, Perl, Python, and R, may be acceptable, and your entry may make use of open-source libraries that are available for Linux, but please ask us first, and do so no later than <strong>7 April 2013</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Participants submitting open-source entries are entered into events 1 and 2, and into event 3 if their entries include QT measurements. These entries will be run on set C by the challenge organizers; scores will be returned as soon as possible after submission, but participants should expect that scoring will require a day or two (possibly longer near the major deadlines).</p>\n\n<p>Participants submitting set B annotations (&quot;closed-source entries&quot;) are entered into events 4 and 5, and into event 6 if their entries include QT measurements.</p>\n\n<p>Participants may submit both open-source entries and closed-source entries, but <strong>the total number of entries from any participant or team is limited to 8 (3 in Phase 1, and 5 in Phase 2, as described below)</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Awards will be presented to the most successful eligible participants during <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computing in Cardiology</a> (CinC) 2013. To be eligible for an award, you must: <a>&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Join <a href=\"https://physionet.org/users/\">PhysioNetWorks</a> if you are not already a member, and follow the link from your PhysioNetWorks home page to &quot;PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2013&quot; to register as a particpant. Joining the project creates a Challenge Participant Page for you, where you will submit your entries and receive your scores.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a preliminary Challenge entry via PhysioNetWorks no later than <strong>25 April 2013</strong>. (The period before this deadline is Phase 1.) You may submit <strong>up to three Phase 1 entries</strong> before this deadline, at most <strong>one entry per week</strong>. (Use them or lose them!)</li>\n\t<li>Submit an acceptable abstract on your work on the Challenge to <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/\">Computing in Cardiology</a> no later than <strong>1 May 2013</strong>. <em>Include an event 1 test set score (and optionally an event 2 test set score) for at least one Phase 1 entry in your abstract.</em> Please select &quot;PhysioNet/CinC Challenge&quot; as the topic of your abstract, so it can be identified easily by the abstract review committee.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a final Challenge entry via PhysioNetWorks during Phase 2 (on or after <strong>1 June</strong> but no later than <strong>25 August 2013</strong>). You may submit <strong>up to five Phase 2 entries</strong> between 1 June and 25 August, at most <strong>one entry per week</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>The test set scores (from either Phase 1 or Phase 2) will determine the final rankings of the entries, with the top-ranked entries in each event eligible for awards.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a full (4-page) paper on your work on the Challenge to CinC no later than <strong>9 September 2013</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Attend CinC 2013 (<strong>22-25 September 2013</strong>, in Zaragoza, Spain) and present your work there.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>An important goal of this Challenge, and of others in the annual series of PhysioNet/CinC Challenges, is to accelerate progress on the Challenge questions, not only during the limited period of the Challenge, but also afterward. In pursuit of this goal, we strongly encourage participants to submit open-source entries that will be made freely available after the conclusion of the Challenge via PhysioNet.</p>\n\n<p>Eligible authors of the entries that receive the best test set scores in each Challenge event will receive award certificates during the closing plenary session of CinC on 25 September 2013. In recognition of their contributions to further work on the Challenge problems, eligible authors of the open-source entries that receive the best test set scores will also receive monetary awards. No team or individual will receive more than one such monetary award.</p>\n\n<h3>Frequently asked questions about the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p><strong>If I don&#39;t submit all 3 preliminary (Phase 1) entries, can I add the unused ones to my quota of 5 Phase 2 entries?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No. We are trying to encourage both experimentation with multiple approaches and sustained effort. In past Challenges some participants have used their entire allowance of entries before the first deadline, and others have saved their entries until hours before the final deadline. The most successful participants have usually reflected on each set of results, refining their ideas (and not merely their decision thresholds) before submitting the next entry. This approach yields better results, and it also allows us to review your entries and provide scores more rapidly than if we receive a large fraction of them just before the deadlines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Should annotations be written to files? The rules are not clear.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The output for each 1-minute test record should be a file of annotations.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter the open-source events (1, 2, and 3), your entry must be in the form of software. We will run your software on each of the records in the hidden test set (set C), and redirect its <a href=\"https://physionet.org/faq.shtml#stdio\">standard output</a> to a file for each test record. The requirement to write to standard output rather than to a named file allows us to run your software in a secure &quot;sandbox&quot; environment, which is necessary to make it practical for us to conduct these events.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter the other events (4, 5, and 6), your entry should be a set of annotation files that you will create yourself by running your software using each of the records in the open test set (set B). Since you will run your software yourself for these events, it may create the files directly, or (as for the open-source events) it can write the annotations to its standard output and you can capture that standard output in a file.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://physionet.org/faq.shtml#stdio\">What is a &quot;standard input&quot; or a &quot;standard output&quot;?</a> if this is confusing.</p>\n\n<p>An additional point of potential confusion is that we have provided reference annotation files for the training set (set A) in both .fqrs (PhysioBank- compatible binary) and .fqrs.txt (text) formats. We expect that most participants will find it easier to generate text-format output, but we will accept either format.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do the numbers in the .fqrs files refer to the line numbers in the MS Excel files, or do they refer to the time values in column A of the MS Excel files?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are no MS Excel files in the challenge data sets.</p>\n\n<p>The .fqrs.txt files contain times of occurrence of fetal QRS complexes in the respective records. Each number is the elapsed time in milliseconds from the beginning of the record to a fetal QRS. The .csv files contain five columns; the first two lines describe the contents of these columns and the units. Beginning on the third line, the first column contains the elapsed time in seconds from the beginning of the record to the time of observation of the samples of the four signals in the remaining columns. So, for example, the first number in a01.fqrs.txt is 355, and this marks a fetal QRS that occurs 355 milliseconds after the beginning of record a01. The corresponding samples are those in the line of a0.csv that begins with 0.355 (which is the 358th line in a0.csv, since the first two lines are column headers and the third line begins with 0.000).</p>\n\n<p>The .fqrs files contain the same information as the .fqrs.txt files, but in the binary format that is used throughout PhysioBank for annotation files. It is readable using software in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB software package</a>, but not using MS Excel. Similarly, the .dat files contain the same information as the .csv files, but in a binary PhysioBank- and WFDB-compatible format that cannot be read using MS Excel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does &#39;-&#39; mean in the .csv files?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What does &#39;-32768&#39; mean in the .dat files?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The special value &#39;-&#39; appears in the .csv files, and the special value -32768 appears in the .dat files, when the output of the A/D converter is invalid (for example, if the analog signal is out of the input range of the ADC, or if the transducer or cables are disconnected). Samples with this special value indicate that no valid observation of the signal was recorded during that sampling interval; you may either ignore them or use the information that the signal was lost as a contribution to an assessment of the quality of the signal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are there separate events for fetal HR (1 and 4) and fetal RR (2 and 5)? How could there be any difference in the outcomes of these events?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s likely that rankings for events 1 and 2 (or 4 and 5) will be correlated, but it is quite possible to obtain good results in event 1 and poor results in event 2 or vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>An entry that detects fQRSs but does not determine their locations accurately will score well on event 1 and poorly on event 2. This might happen if the numbers of false negatives (missed fQRSs) and false positives (extra detections) are nearly equal, as would be expected of an optimized fQRS detector in the presence of significant noise; the FHR would be fairly accurate but the FRR intervals would not be.</p>\n\n<p>An entry that includes a high-specificity fQRS detector may make many more false negative errors than false positive errors in the presence of significant noise; it will underestimate FHR and thus will score poorly on event 1, but if it is able to determine accurate locations for consecutive true positive detections, it will score well on event 2.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For entries in the open-source events, must I submit the source code, or just a statement of what software was used?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Participants in the open-source events (1, 2, and 3) must supply the sources (i.e., the actual source code, not just a reference to it) for their entries. We will publish a selection of these entries on PhysioNet after the conclusion of the challenge, with full credit to their authors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>May I submit an open-source entry (for events 1, 2, and 3) that includes functions that will not be published?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sorry, no. The open-source events require complete open-source entries, because our aim is to advance the state of the art by encouraging the development and publication of software that others can use, adapt to their needs, and develop further if they wish.</p>\n\n<p>Participants are free to make use of open-source implementations of functions in open-source challenge entries. Open-source implementations of common functions such as cross-correlation are easy to find. Open-source QRS detection functions (suitable for finding the maternal QRS complexes) are also available (for example, see gqrs, sqrs, or wqrs in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB software package</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Each participant-team may submit up to 10 entries, and they can be any mixture of open-source and non-open-source entries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I score my entry in MATLAB or Windows?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Note: before running this new tool please make sure that the directory in which you are running it on has been properly and fully backed up. The scoring procedure requires a JAR file, that can be obtained by downloading and installing the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/matlab/wfdb-app-matlab/\">WFDB App Toolbox </a>for MATLAB.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The scoring requires that all the data and annotations for one set be stored in the same directory. For instance, in scoring record a01, the following files are necessary at the testing directory:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>a01.dat - WFDB Binary Data File (provided by PhysioNet)</li>\n\t<li>a01.hea - WFDB Header File (provided by PhysioNet)</li>\n\t<li>a01.fqrs - WFDB Binary Annotation File (provided by PhysioNet)</li>\n\t<li>a01.entry1 - WFDB Binary Annotation File (generated by the user)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>NON-MATLAB Users can score their entries by running the following command from a terminal or command prompt (assuming the WFDB App toobox was installed at /home/foo/wfdb and the annotation data reside in /home/foo/pn2013/data):</p>\n\n<pre>           java -cp &quot;/home/foo/wfdb/mcode/wfdb-app-JVM6-0-0-2.jar&quot; org.physionet.wfdb.Score2013 a01 /home/foo/pn2013/data/ fqrs entry1\n</pre>\n\n<p>This will score your entry using Java&#39;s virtual machine.</p>\n\n<p>MATLAB Users can score their individual entries by running the following command from the MATLAB prompt (assuming same installation as the example above ):</p>\n\n<pre>   \n          cd /home/foo/pn2013/data;\n          [score1,score1]=score2013(&#39;a01&#39;,&#39;fqrs&#39;,&#39;entry1&#39;)\n</pre>\n\n<p>Alternatively, MATLAB users can also run the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2013/genresults.m\">genresults.m</a> script that scores all the files in that directory (writing the output of <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2013/physionet2013.m\">physionet2013.m</a> into WFDB annotation binaries files).</p>\n\n<p>Note for Windows users: The scoring procedure requires Administrator privileges in order to generate some temporary cache files. To run the scoring procedure in MATLAB or at the command prompt, before you start the MATLAB or command prompt make sure you right click on it and select the &quot;run as Administrator&quot; option. The source code for the patchtann.c, the JAR file, and the toolbox can be found <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/wfdb-app-toolbox/source/browse/\">here</a> and you can compile it from source if you wish.</p>\n\n<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>\n\n<p>The challenge organizers wish to thank Joachim Behar, Gari Clifford, Marcelino Martinez, Dawid Roj, Reza Sameni, Anton Tokarev, and their colleagues for their generous contributions of data and expertise in support of this challenge.</p>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><a><strong>[FHR history]:</strong></a></dt>\n\t<dd>Jenkins HML. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1292086/pdf/jrsocmed00151-0028.pdf\">Thirty years of electronic intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring: discussion paper</a>.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>This challenge aims to encourage the exploration of robust methods for locating heart beats in continuous long-term data from bedside monitors and similar devices that record not only ECG but usually other physiologic signals as well, including pulsatile signals that directly reflect cardiac activity, and other signals that may have few or no observable markers of heart beats. Our goal is to accelerate development of <em>open-source research tools</em> that can reliably, efficiently, and automatically analyze data such as that contained in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2wdb/\">MIMIC II Waveform Database</a>, making use of all relevant information.</p>\n\n<p>Most existing beat detectors are QRS detectors, operating on the ECG. In this challenge as in many clinical and research settings, although the ECG is usually available, its quality may vary considerably over time, and on occasion the ECG may be missing entirely. Thus even an excellent QRS detector is not sufficient to be a successful challenge entry, since examination of pulsatile signals such as continuous blood pressure (BP) and photoplethysmograms (PPGs) can help to fill in the gaps. Even signals that are not acquired as indicators of cardiac activity, such as EEG signals, are often contaminated by ECG components that can be detected and exploited. In most subjects, the observed relationships between respiration and heart rate can be used to model heart rate, and together with nearby context derived from ECG or other cardiac signals, these models can predict beat locations from respiratory signals.</p>\n\n<h3>Rules and Deadlines</h3>\n\n<p>All deadlines occur at noon GMT (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\">UTC</a>) on the dates mentioned below. If you do not know the difference between GMT and your local time, find out what it is <em>before</em> the deadline!</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge will take place in three phases, with a week-long hiatus between phases I and II, and a shorter hiatus between phases II and III. The week-long hiatus is necessary to ensure that all Phase I entries can be scored before the CinC abstract deadline (see below); the shorter hiatus is to allow all Phase II entries to be scored before Phase III begins. Entries will not be accepted during either hiatus.</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td><em>Start at<br>\n\t\t\tnoon GMT on</em></td>\n\t\t\t<td><em>Entry<br>\n\t\t\tlimit</em></td>\n\t\t\t<td><em>End at<br>\n\t\t\tnoon GMT on</em></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Phase I</td>\n\t\t\t<td>7 January</td>\n\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>7 April</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>[Hiatus]</td>\n\t\t\t<td>7 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0</td>\n\t\t\t<td>16 April</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Phase II</td>\n\t\t\t<td>16 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>22 <s>15</s> June</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>[Hiatus]</td>\n\t\t\t<td>22 <s>15</s> June</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0</td>\n\t\t\t<td>23 <s>16</s> June</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Phase III</td>\n\t\t\t<td>23 <s>16</s> June</td>\n\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>15 August<br>\n\t\t\t(final deadline)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>All entries must be received no later than the end of Phase III (<strong>noon GMT on Friday, 15 August 2014</strong>).

Unused entries may <em>not</em> be carried over to later phases. Entries that cannot be scored (because of missing components, improper formatting, or excessive run time) are not counted against the entry limits.</p>\n\n<div>\n<p><strong>To encourage collaboration among participants</strong>, we will publish each participant&#39;s most successful entry, and its ranking, at the start of Phase II on 16 April and Phase III on 23 <s>16</s> June. Study these entries as the Challenge continues, and learn from them; then form alliances with other participants whose ideas may complement yours.</p>\n\n<p>The authors of the top entries at the ends of Phases I, II, and III will receive awards of up to US$1000 during the closing ceremony of <a href=\"http://web.cinc.org/2014/\">Computing in Cardiology 2014</a>, on Wednesday afternoon, 10 September 2014, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>\n\n<p>To be eligible for an award, you must do all of the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Submit at least one entry that can be scored before the phase I deadline <strong>(noon GMT on Monday, 7 April 2014)</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Submit an acceptable abstract (about 300 words) on your work on the Challenge to <a href=\"http://web.cinc.org/2014/\">Computing in Cardiology</a> no later than <strong>14 April 2014</strong>. Include the overall score for at least one phase I entry in your abstract. Please select &quot;PhysioNet/CinC Challenge&quot; as the topic of your abstract, so it can be identified easily by the abstract review committee. You will be notified if your abstract has been accepted by email from CinC during the first week in June.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a full (4-page) paper on your work on the Challenge to CinC no later than <strong>1 September 2014</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Attend CinC 2014 (<strong>7-10 September 2014</strong>) and present your work there.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For each of Phases I and II, we will award US$300 to the first-place team, $200 to the second-place team, and $100 to each of the third-, fourth-, and fifth-place teams. For Phase III, these awards will be $400, $300, and $200 respectively. Eligible teams may receive at most one award for each phase.</p>\n\n<p><em>Please note that the CinC abstract deadline is more than two weeks earlier in 2014 than its traditional date!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Challenge Data</h3>\n\n<p>Data for this Challenge are 10-minute (or occasionally shorter) excerpts (&quot;records&quot;) of longer multiparameter recordings of human adults, including patients with a wide range of problems as well as healthy volunteers. Each record contains four to eight signals; the first is an ECG signal in each case, but the others are a variety of simultaneously recorded physiologic signals that may be useful for robust beat detection. Signals have been digitized at rates between 120 and 1000 samples per second; in any given record, however, all signals are sampled at the same, fixed frequency.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>training data set</strong> for this challenge is available for study. It is a set of 100 records, named 100, 101, ..., 199, and it is provided <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2014/set-p/\">here</a>. You may wish to explore these records visually using <a href=\"https://physionet.org/lightwave/?db=challenge/2014/set-p\">LightWAVE</a>. This data set is also available for download as a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2014/set-p.zip\">zip archive</a> and as a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2014/set-p.tar.gz\">tarball</a> (about 111 MB in either format).</p>\n\n<p>A new <strong>augmented training set</strong>, consisting of 100 records from the original \\ test set has been released <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/training.zip\">here</a>.The annotations were not generated from any specific channel and there was no fixed fiducial point, since some of the annotations were placed manually. The annotations include only beat labels and do not differentiate between beat types (all annotated beats were arbitrarily set to normal, &#39;N&#39; beats).</p>\n\n<p>The training set includes many records that can be processed without errors by the sample entry using the ECG only, but others will pose serious difficulty unless your entry makes good use of available information in the other signals; a few of the difficult records are 112, 133, 169, and 188.</p>\n\n<p>A set of <em>reference beat annotations</em> for the training set is also available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2014/set-p-atr.tar.gz\">here</a>. In this Challenge, reference beat annotations represent the preponderance of expert opinions about the locations of the observed (or imputed) QRS complexes in the ECG signal.</p>\n\n<p>A separate <strong>hidden test data set</strong> has been assembled for evaluating Challenge entries. Performance of the challenge entries on this hidden test set determines their rankings and thus the winners of the Challenge. The test set will not be available for study by participants, in order to avoid the possibility that entries will be &quot;tuned&quot; (optimized for high performance) on the test data and that the results will therefore be less predictive of performance on unknown data. Previously unused records will be added to the hidden data set at the start of Phases II and III.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important differences between the training set and the test set:</strong> The training set is intended to give participants an opportunity to see some of the problems their entries will face in the challenge, and to give us a way to verify that submitted entries are working as their authors intend. The performance of challenge entries on the training set does not contribute in any way to their scores and ranks in the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The test set contains a wider variety of signals than in the training set. A successful entry needs to be able to discover their relationships and exploit features that can predict beat locations. Unlike the training set (sampled at a uniform 250 samples per second per signal), signals in the test set have been sampled at rates between 120 and 1000 samples per second.</p>\n\n<h3>Entering the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>To participate in the challenge, you will need to create software that is able to read the test data and record the times of occurrence of the beats in PhysioBank-compatible annotation files, without user interaction, in our <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/#sandbox\">test environment</a>. A sample entry (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/entry.tar.gz\">entry.tar.gz</a> or <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/entry.zip\">entry.zip</a>) that demonstrates how this can be done is available to help you get started. It must be possible to run your software on GNU/Linux using open-source components only.</p>\n\n<p><em>It is not necessary to develop your entry using a Linux platform.</em> The sample entry runs on FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and MS-Windows as well as GNU/Linux. If you avoid the use of platform-specific code and libraries, your entry should be able to run in our GNU/Linux test environment.</p>\n\n<p>You may use any programming language (or combination of languages) supported using open source compilers or interpreters on GNU/Linux, including C, C++, Fortran, Haskell, Java, Octave, Perl, Python, and R. Other languages may be available.</p>\n\n<p>Your entry must be able to run from beginning to end without requiring user interaction. It doesn&#39;t need, and should not require, a graphical user interface.</p>\n\n<p>Your entry should attempt to locate all of the beats in its input, starting from the beginning of each recording. <strong>No learning period is allowed;</strong> missing the first beat or the last one will affect your score to the same extent as missing any other beat. Locating every beat, even at the beginning of a recording, is difficult in real-time clinical applications. For off-line analysis of recorded data for research as well as some clinical applications, however, there is no need for real-time analysis per se. In this challenge, there are no real-time constraints or limitations with respect to decision delay. Your code may read any portion of the input record, even the entire record, before recording any beat locations. Its analysis can be sequential or non-sequential, forwards, backwards, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Your entry&#39;s annotations do not need to be placed at the precise locations of the reference beat annotations; in order to be counted as correct, they may be located anywhere within 150 ms of a reference annotation. Note, however, that all of the reference annotations are aligned with respect to the observed or expected QRS locations; thus, for example, if a blood pressure (BP) waveform was used to locate a beat that could not be observed directly in the ECG because of noise or signal loss, the reference annotation for that beat would be located at the expected position of the QRS complex, based on nearby measurements of the delay between the QRS complex and the BP waveform feature used for beat detection. Since this delay can easily exceed 150 ms, your entry needs to make similar adjustments to beat locations when it relies on non-ECG signals.</p>\n\n<p>The output annotation files must contain annotations in time order, but you don&#39;t need to worry about this point unless your entry attempts to generate annotation files without using the WFDB library. The WFDB library&#39;s wfdbquit function (which should be invoked to close open files) sorts annotations automatically so that they are written in time order in the annotation file.</p>\n\n<p>To handle signals sampled at varying frequencies, you may use the WFDB library&#39;s sampfreq function to determine the sampling frequency of the input signals, and then adjust any parameters that depend on the sampling frequency accordingly; see gqrs.c in the sample entry for an example. Alternatively, you can use the WFDB library&#39;s setsampfreq function to force the input data to be resampled at your preferred sampling frequency; see <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb/app/wabp.c\">wabp.c</a> for an example of this approach. The first approach is preferred, since it does not introduce resampling noise, and it will be faster than the second, but the differences are likely to be minor.</p>\n\n<h3>Preparing an entry for the challenge</h3>\n\n<p>When you submit your entry, it must include your software in <em>source form</em>, as well as a complete set of the 100 annotation files that you have created by running your software, using the training data set as input, and a pair of <em>scripts</em> (batch files) that can be used to replicate the annotation files in our test environment, given your software in source form, and the test data set. Since entries are tested and scored automatically, it is essential to submit them in a format that can be understood by our literal-minded autoscorer. Please follow the guidelines in this section very carefully!</p>\n\n<p>Participants should download the sample entry (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/entry.tar.gz\">entry.tar.gz</a> or <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/entry.zip\">entry.zip</a>). Entries should mimic the layout of the sample entry; specifically, they must contain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>setup.sh, a bash script run once before any other code from the entry; use this to compile your code as needed</li>\n\t<li>next.sh, a bash script run once per training or test record; it should analyze the record using your code, saving the results as a <em>beat annotation file</em> with the annotator name qrs</li>\n\t<li>AUTHORS, a plain text file listing the members of your team who contributed to your code, and their affiliations</li>\n\t<li>sources/, a directory containing your code in source form; this should include sources for any custom or non-standard libraries needed (and setup.sh should include commands for building and linking any such libraries to your code)</li>\n\t<li>challenge/2014/set-p/, a directory containing the annotation files for each record in the training set; these must be named 100.qrs, 101.qrs, ..., 199.qrs. These files are used for validation only, not for ranking entries (see below).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See the comments in the sample entry&#39;s setup.sh and next.sh to learn how to customize these scripts for your entry.</p>\n\n<p>See gqrs.c for an example of how to read the data and generate annotation files in the correct format using the WFDB library functions wfdbinit, getvec, putann, and wfdbquit. The WFDB library, and simpler examples of its use, can be found in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB Software Package</a>. The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wpg/\">WFDB Programmer&#39;s Guide</a> provides a tutorial, examples, and a reference to the library functions.</p>\n\n<div><strong>If your preferred programming language is MATLAB or Octave m-code:</strong>\n\n<p>In order to submit an entry written in m-code successfully, it must be able to run using <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/\">GNU Octave</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A sample entry written in Octave m-code is available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/octave/\">here</a>. The entry illustrates how to install and use the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/matlab/wfdb-app-matlab/\">WFDB Toolbox for MATLAB and Octave</a> to read the Challenge data and to write beat annotation files.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>We verify that your code is working as you intended, by comparing the annotation files that you submit with your entry with annotation files produced by your code running in our test environment using the same inputs. If your code passes this validation test, it is then evaluated and scored using a large <em>hidden test data set</em>, and these scores determine the ranking of the entries and the outcome of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the <em>required</em> components, your entry may include a file named DRYRUN. If this file is present, your entry is not evaluated using the hidden test data, and it will not be counted against your limit of five entries per phase; you will receive either a confirmation of success or a diagnostic report, but no scores. Use this feature to verify that none of the required components are missing, that your setup.sh script works in the test environment, and that your next.sh script produces the expected output for the training data within the time limits.</p>\n\n<h3>Submitting an entry</h3>\n\n<p>Please do not submit entries by email; they will not be read or scored.</p>\n\n<p>All submissions must be made via the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2014 project on PhysioNetWorks. Make a free personal account for yourself and log in at <a href=\"https://physionet.org/users/\">https://physionet.org/users/</a>, then click on the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/works/PhysioNetCinCChallenge2014\">PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2014</a> link in the Projects section of your PhysioNetWorks home page. Join the project at any time while the Challenge is open to create your participant page.</p>\n\n<p>Upload your entry for automated scoring using the form on your participant page. Note that it must be named entry.tar.gz or entry.zip, and its contents must be laid out as described in the previous section. Improperly-formatted entries, including entries that are missing required components, will not be scored.</p>\n\n<h3>Test environment</h3>\n\n<p>Entries are evaluated in a GNU/Linux environment (<a href=\"http://www.debian.org/distrib/\">64-bit Debian 7.3 &quot;Wheezy&quot;</a>), with a typical set of open-source software development compilers, interpreters, libraries, plugins, and utilities (including gcc, gfortran, ghc, java, make, octave, perl, python, and R; see a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/sandbox/package-list.txt\">complete list of installed packages</a> as of Tuesday, 26 April 2016 at 18:11 EDT). We will consider reasonable requests to add other packages from the Debian stable repository to the test environment at any time during the first four weeks of each Challenge phase.</p>\n\n<div>\n<p><strong>Additions to the test environment:</strong> <a href=\"http://arma.sourceforge.net/\">armadillo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.boost.org/\">boost</a> libraries (13 January); <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/liboctave-dev\">liboctave-dev</a> (30 January); <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/gsl-bin\">gsl-bin</a> (3 February); <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/octave-statistics\">octave-statistics</a> (15 March); imagemagick, imagemagick-common, libdjvulibre-text, libdjvulibre21, libexiv2-12, libilmbase6, liblensfun-data, liblensfun0, liblqr-1-0:amd64, libmagickcore5:amd64, libmagickcore5-extra:amd64, libmagickwand5:amd64, libnetpbm10, libopenexr6, netpbm, octave-control, octave-general, octave-image, octave-miscellaneous, octave-optim, octave-signal, octave-specfun, octave-struct, ufraw-batch, units (22 April)</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>In addition to these standard Debian packages, the test environment includes the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB Software Package</a> including the WFDB library. The WFDB library can be linked with C or C++ code using -lwfdb as an option to gcc, as illustrated in setup.sh in the sample entry. <em>Your entry will not have access to a network connection</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Evaluation of your entry will be conducted by a supervisor script that looks similar to this pseudocode:</p>\n\n<pre><strong>stage 1:</strong>\n    unpack entry.tar.gz or entry.zip, report error and exit if unable to do so\n    check that all required components are present, report error and exit if\n      any are missing\n    run &quot;setup.sh&quot;, report error and exit if it fails or needs more than five\n      minutes\n\n<strong>stage 2:</strong>\n    for each record R in the training set\n        run &quot;next.sh R&quot;, report error and exit if it fails or needs more than\n          40 <s>20</s> seconds\n        compare R.qrs with the copy of R.qrs from entry.tar.gz or entry.zip,\n          report error and exit if they are different\n    exit if the entry includes a file named &quot;DRYRUN&quot;\n\n<strong>stage 3:</strong>\n    set cumulative run time to zero\n    for each record R in the hidden test set\n        run &quot;next.sh R&quot;;  if its running time reaches 40 <s>20</s> seconds, or if it\n          fails, interrupt it and create an empty R.qrs\n        update cumulative run time, report error and exit if more than 1 hour\n\n<strong>stage 4:</strong>\n    for each record R in the hidden test set\n        compare R.qrs with the reference annotations, count TP, FN, FP\n        remove any files created by next.sh\n    calculate and report gross and average Se and +P, and overall score\n    exit\n</pre>\n\n<p>The supervisor script keeps track of the time needed by your setup.sh and next.sh scripts in order to avoid spending an excessive amount of time attempting to run a misbehaving entry. An error exit will result in no score for the entry, and the entry will not count against your limit of five entries in each phase of the Challenge. Most entries will not approach the time limits; in our test environment, the sample entry&#39;s setup.sh requires only a second or two, and its next.sh processes a 10-minute record in about 35 milliseconds. We will consider reasonable requests to adjust the time limits on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n\n<p>Additional details are available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/sandbox/\">here</a>, together with instructions for creating a replica of our test environment, which you may use for development if you wish, or for troubleshooting if needed.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>If your entry is properly formatted, and nothing is missing, it is tested and scored automatically, and you will receive your scores when the test is complete (depending on your entry&#39;s run time, this may take an hour or more). If you receive an error message instead, read it carefully and correct the problem(s) before resubmitting.</p>\n\n<p>The annotations generated by your code are compared beat-by-beat with reference annotations that reflect the consensus of several expert annotators, using <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wag/bxb-1.htm\">bxb(1)</a> and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wag/sumsta-1.htm\">sumstats(1)</a> from the WFDB Software Package. As noted above, no learning period is allowed (bxb is run with the -f 0 option so that comparison begins with the first annotation in each record).</p>\n\n<p>Your entry&#39;s scores are reported as gross and average sensitivity, and gross and average positive predictivity (four numbers, each between 0 and 100; see below). For purposes of ranking, we average these four performance statistics together with equal weight to obtain an overall score. The top-ranked entry will have the highest overall score.</p>\n\n<h3>Beat-by-beat comparison and calculation of performance statistics</h3>\n\n<p>The bxb application matches your entry&#39;s annotations (&quot;test annotations&quot;) with reference annotations to count, for each record in the test data set, the numbers of correctly-detected beats (true positives, or TP), missed beats (false negatives, or FN), and detections of non-beats (false positives, or FP). To match a reference annotation, a test annotation must be located within 150 ms of the reference annotation, and must be the nearest test annotation to the reference annotation.</p>\n\n<p>In this challenge, sensitivity (Se) is the percentage of beats that are true positives, and positive predictivity (+P) is the percentage of detections that are true positives:</p>\n\n<blockquote><em>Se = 100 &middot; TP / (TP + FN)<br>\n+P = 100 &middot; TP / (TP + FP) </em></blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Gross</em> statistics are derived from the sums of all TP, FP, and FN over the test data set; <em>average</em> statistics are the means of the statistics calculated individually for each record of the test data set.</p>\n\n<p>If an entry fails to generate an annotation file for a given test set record, or if it does not complete its analysis of the record within the 40-second <s>20-second</s> time limit, any output it has produced is replaced with an output annotation file that contains a single annotation that does not match any reference annotation. In such cases, the beat-by-beat comparison yields 1 FN for each beat marked in the reference annotation file for the record, 0 TP, and 1 FP. The Se and +P for the record are both 0 (affecting the average Se and +P).</p>\n\n<h3>Frequently asked questions about the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p><strong>How can I determine if my entry is fast enough?</strong></p>\n\n<p>As noted above, the sample entry processes a ten-minute record in about 35 milliseconds in our test environment, or about 300 times faster than necessary on average. Measure the run time of the sample entry on your computer, and compare it to the run time of your entry on the same data. If your entry requires no more than 300 times as long to run than the sample entry on average, it is probably fast enough.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the 40-second <s>20-second</s> limit per record is intended to allow extra time for processing unusually complex records. If your entry&#39;s mean run time is greater than about 10 seconds per record in the test environment, it is unlikely to complete its processing of the full 300-record test set in phase III within the one-hour limit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can I get diagnostic output from my entry?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, in stages 1 and 2 (see above), but not in stages 3 and 4. The general rule is that diagnostic output is available if it was produced without access to test set data.</p>\n\n<p>In stage 1, if your setup.sh fails (exits with non-zero status), anything it writes to the standard output is reported and the evaluation stops. Otherwise, no output from setup.sh is reported.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in stage 2, if your next.sh fails on a <em>training set record</em>, anything it writes to the standard output is reported and the evaluation stops (the remaining records are not tested). Otherwise, no output from next.sh is reported.</p>\n\n<p>In stage 3, however, if your next.sh is unable to process a <em>test set record</em> within 40 <s>20</s> seconds, it will receive poor partial scores for that record (see above), but the evaluation will continue.</p>\n\n<p>If your entry exceeds the one-hour time limit for processing the test set in stage 3, the percentage of records completely processed within one hour is reported. Otherwise, if your entry failed to process one or more test set records, or if it did not complete its analysis of one or more records within the 40-second <s>20-second</s> per-record time limit, the numbers of failures and timeouts will be reported, along with the scores. <em>No other diagnostic output relating to test set records will be reported.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>May I submit a binary (executable) entry without a complete set of sources?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Entries that do not include a complete set of sources are ineligible for awards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is MATLAB available in the test environment?</strong></p>\n\n<p>MATLAB will be available when the scoring interface enviroment re-opens.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/octave/\">working example of a Challenge entry written in m-code</a> is available for study and as a starting point for developing your own m-code entry. The m-code in the sample works using either MATLAB or Octave.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will your test environment run multi-threaded code on multiple cores? If so, how many cores will your test environment have and how much memory? Will pthread libraries be pre-installed?</strong></p>\n\n<p>See the details about the test environment <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/sandbox/\">here</a>. Briefly, the VMs have dual-core CPUs with 2GB of (shared) RAM. The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/sandbox/package-list.txt\">complete list of pre-installed packages</a> includes libpth20.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will your linux test box have Qt installed, and if so what version?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No. Your entry should not require a GUI since it will run non-interactively under the control of your setup.sh and next.sh scripts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will the wfdb header files and libraries be pre-installed on the test machines such that we can just #include &lt;wfdb/wfdb.h&gt; in C code and link with -lwfdb?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Across the training samples there are 46 non-normal beats, variously annotated as &quot;V&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot;. Are we supposed to try to detect and annotate aberrant beats? Would the prediction error be calculated the same if we annotate them as normal, &quot;N&quot;?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, and yes. For this Challenge, it is not necessary to distinguish between different types of beats, but you should try to detect all of the beats including any abnormal beats.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The annotated locations of the QRS complexes appear to be consistently about midway between the peak at R and the trough at S. Is there a reason the annotations are not located at the point closest to the maximum R amplitude? Is there a formal definition for the location of the QRS complex that you can specify?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most of the reference annotations were initially generated using a QRS detector that placed them at the centroid of a lag-corrected filtered version of the ECG signal. If the complexes are monophasic, these annotations will appear at or very near the major extremum; otherwise, they will appear at intermediate locations. This approach was chosen for stability with respect to observed fluctuations of the mean cardiac electrical axis that occur as a result of physical motion of the sensing electrodes relative to the heart, such as during normal respiration.</p>\n\n<p>All of the reference annotations were visually reviewed, and corrected where necessary. Some of the initial annotations were repositioned, some were removed, and additional annotations were added (especially when necessary because of severe noise in, or loss of, the ECG) as a result of these reviews. The expert annotators were able to place their annotations as they wished.</p>\n\n<p>It should be emphasized that a correct detection of a beat by a challenge entry does not require determining the precise location of any specific feature; it is sufficient for your software to place its beat annotation anywhere within 150 ms of a reference beat annotation, which will be placed within the observed or expected QRS complex in the ECG signal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there some kind of listserv for participants to post questions and comments?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We hope to launch project-specific wikis on PhysioNetWorks within a few weeks, and the Challenge project will be one of the first to make use of this feature. Until then, please send your questions by email, and if they are of general interest to participants, we will post them (anonymously) and their answers here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>May I use code or complete applications (such as gqrs or wabp) from the WFDB Software Package in my entry?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes. You are not required to reinvent anything that you can find in existing open-source software. (The sample entry <em>is</em> gqrs, so you will need to add something more in order to improve on it!)</p>\n\n<p><em>All</em> of the software that has been preinstalled in the test environment is open-source software, and you may use any of it in your entry.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Challenge rules do not impose any restrictions on the inclusion of existing open-source code in your entry, please be careful to abide by the original author&#39;s license. If the license appears to restrict how the code may be used, it may not be an open-source license. Be sure to acknowledge the authors of any code you incorporate in your entry, and cite the original sources in any publications that describe or make use of your entry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is a list of names of signals in the hidden test set available?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are not currently planning to provide such a list, but the first signal in each record will be an ECG signal, and will usually be marked as &quot;ECG&quot;. The non-ECG signals will include a variety of pulsatile signals, often including &quot;ABP&quot; (radial arterial blood pressure) and &quot;PLETH&quot; or &quot;PPG&quot; (fingertip photoplethysmogram). Your code may be able to recognize other signals that also contain (quasi-)periodic waveforms that have consistent relationships with the ECG. There may be other signals such as &quot;RESP&quot; (respiration) that are less clearly coupled with cardiac activity. We are hoping to attract entries that discover relationships among the signals and exploit those relationships where appropriate, even in situations in which the signals may be mislabeled (yes, this is also possible -- it&#39;s the real world!).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can a record contain more than one signal with the same name (for example, two or more &quot;ECG&quot; signals)?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In some cases, there may be multiple signals of the same type, but they will never have identical names (for example, two ECG signals in the same record will usually be labeled as &quot;ECG0&quot; and &quot;ECG1&quot;).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does &#39;.../fstat.m shadows a core library function&#39; mean in my entry&#39;s diagnostic output&#39;?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This message appears when running an m-code entry, and it results from the presence of the fstat function in Octave&#39;s statistics package, which hides a deprecated fstat function that has not yet been removed from Octave&#39;s core library. The warning is harmless and will not prevent your entry from running; if your entry does not run successfully, look for another cause.</p>\n\n<p>In the very unlikely case that you wanted to use the deprecated fstat, note that Octave&#39;s stat function now accepts either a filename (as always) or a file descriptor (as the deprecated fstat did previously).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is something wrong with training set record 116?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This record is 1 minute and 49 seconds long, unlike the others in the training set, almost all of which are a full 10 minutes in length. Your entry should be able to handle occasional short records, which may also occur in the test set.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I manually install an Octave package in the test environment?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Remember that the test environment does not include a network interface. You must submit any code that your entry needs as part of your entry.tar.gz or entry.zip file, since your entry will not be able to download anything at run time. Follow these steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Download the required package tarball(s) from <a href=\"http://octave.sourceforge.net/packages.php\">Octave-Forge</a> and add them to your entry&#39;s main directory (the same directory that contains setup.sh).</li>\n\t<li>Edit your setup.sh script, adding these commands:\n\t<pre>STR=&quot;${OCTAVE} \\&quot;pkg prefix ~ ~;pkg local_list ~/.octave_packages;pkg install YOUR_PACKAGE.tar.gz;quit;\\&quot;&quot;\necho &quot;$STR&quot;  # optional, but helpful for diagnosing problems if they occur\neval ${STR}\n</pre>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any packages you install will remain in the test environment only until your test run has ended; if you submit another entry later, you must reinstall your packages if you still need them.</p>\n\n<p>This FAQ was contributed by Christoph Hoog Antink. The packages that are known to have been installed sucessfully using this method with Octave 3.6.2 during Phase I were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>general-1.3.2.tar.gz</li>\n\t<li>specfun-1.1.0.tar.gz</li>\n\t<li>control-2.4.2.tar.gz</li>\n\t<li>signal-1.2.2.tar.gz</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Note that these four packages are now preinstalled</em>. If your Phase I entry installed any of them, or any other preinstalled package (see the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/sandbox/package-list.txt\">complete list of preinstalled packages)</a>, you will need to remove the code that does so in Phases II and III, since attempting to reinstall an installed package will result in an error, reported in your diagnostc output like this:</p>\n\n<pre>error: load_packages: A(I) = X: X must have the same size as I\nerror: called from:\nerror:   /usr/share/octave/3.6.2/m/pkg/pkg.m at line 2142, column 21\nerror:   /usr/share/octave/3.6.2/m/pkg/pkg.m at line 401, column 7\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Is it possible to change the input sampling frequency using setsampfreq in an m-code entry?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The setsampfreq function is part of the WFDB library, and it is intended to be used by applications written in C or other compiled languages that are linked to the WFDB library. You can write your entry in one of these languages and link it to the WFDB library.</p>\n\n<p>The WFDB Toolbox for MATLAB and Octave provides an m-code interface to many such applications. WFDB Toolbox functions allow you to run these applications as separate processes, capturing their outputs in MATLAB/Octave arrays. If the application calls setsampfreq, its output (the contents of the array(s) that it fills) will reflect this; but the effects of calling setsampfreq do not persist beyond the process in which it is executed, and each call to a function in the Toolbox is executed in its own process &mdash; so this will probably not give you the results you may be hoping for.</p>\n\n<p>As noted above, you can either write your code so that it checks the input sampling frequency and properly handles inputs of different sampling frequencies (which is the preferred approach), or you can resample to your desired sampling frequency. If you choose to resample, we don&#39;t recommend trying to do this in m-code (it&#39;s computationally intensive, and it will be too slow). Rather, write your next.sh script so that it runs the WFDB application <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wag/xform-1.htm\">xform</a> (which is preinstalled in the test environment) to create a new record resampled at the frequency you want, before starting Octave; then analyze the resampled record with Octave. If you take this approach, remember that the annotation file that your entry generates must include timestamps in the units of the original record&#39;s sampling intervals, so your entry will need to compensate for the effects of resampling.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In which folder (directory) are the .hea and .dat input files? Should the .qrs output files be written to this folder?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Your entry is unpacked into your home directory in the test environment, so your home directory contains your setup.sh and next.sh scripts. When these scripts are started, the current directory is your home directory. The .dat and .hea files are copied into your home directory after your setup.sh script exits. Your next.sh script must write the .qrs files into the same directory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you handle entries that contain proprietary (non-free) code?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our original plan was simply to treat any such entries as invalid. This plan has been modified slightly for Phase I only.</p>\n\n<p>It is not possible for the autoscorer to identify non-free code automatically, and it is not feasible for us to review entries as they arrive to determine if they contain non-free code. One purpose of the hiatus between Phases I and II was to allow us time to review the top-scoring entries for the presence of non-free code before announcing the official rankings. We did not expect to discover any non-free code, but we found that several participants had submitted entries containing MathWorks proprietary code, and further investigation uncovered other sources with copyright statements that did not indicate the authors&#39; permission to redistribute their code.</p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t wish to revoke the provisional qualification of the authors of these entries as official participants, especially since it appears that inclusion of non-free code may have been inadvertent in some or all cases -- so we have allowed these entries, if they were scored, to meet the eligibility requirement for submitting a scorable Phase I entry.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, we don&#39;t wish to give awards for entries that do not comply with the rules; this would be unfair to the majority of participants who were careful to follow the rules. Therefore, no awards and no official rankings will be given for entries containing non-free code (whether or not the code was used in the entry).</p>\n\n<p><strong>If I use up all of my entries, can I register again using another email address and get more entries?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Please don&#39;t do this! The limit on the number of entries:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>is necessary in order to make it feasible to evaluate entries within a reasonable time as deadlines approach,</li>\n\t<li>reduces the opportunities for overfitting and consequent development of non-generalizable solutions, and</li>\n\t<li>is an important part of establishing a fair and level playing field for the Challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously we cannot prevent use of multiple email addresses to circumvent the limit on entries, but we consider such behavior abusive and disrespectful to other participants. In Phase I, we have disqualified excess <strong>entries</strong>. <em>If we discover that this has occurred in Phases II or III, we will disqualify offending</em> <strong>participants</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Note, however, that participants are allowed (and encouraged) to join forces to combine the best features of complementary approaches. If you wish to collaborate with another participant or team of participants, each of the team members may use his or her remaining entries jointly with other team members. <strong>Collaborators must be particularly careful to list all team members in their AUTHORS files to avoid disqualification.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are my Phase II scores so much worse than my Phase I scores, for the same code?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Challenge is becoming even more challenging! The Phase II test set consists of 200 records: the 100 records in the Phase I set, and 100 additional records, many of which are considerably more difficult than the average among the first 100. Everyone&#39;s scores are likely to be significantly lower in Phase II. This will happen again in Phase III, when another 100 records are added to the test set.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do not I get &#39;output does not match&#39; errors ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I submit my entry through PhysioNetWorks I get an error message similar to:</p>\n\n<pre>Challenge 2014 entry running ...\nnext.sh 100: output does not match submission\noctave --quiet --eval  &quot;challenge(&#39;100&#39;,0); quit;&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1\n</pre>\n\n<p>This error message indicates that, for whatever reason, the annotations files created by running your entry in our Sandbox environment do not match annotation files submitted with your entry. Please make sure that your submission runs properly in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/sandbox/binary.hybrid.iso\">Sandbox bootable ISO</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We strongly recommend that you use this Sandbox environment to generate the annotation files that you submit along with your entry. You can use a virtual environment, such as VirtualBox, to have the ISO quickly installed and running as a guest on your machine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does my entry seems to get hanged, printing a &#39;save to `octave-core&#39; complete&#39; error ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>My entry never finishes running and I get a message similar to:</p>\n\n<pre>core library function\nwarning: time stamp for `/home/vmuser/challenge.m&#39; is in the future\nattempting to save variables to `octave-core&#39;...\nsave to `octave-core&#39; completeChallenge 2014 entry running ...\nnext.sh 100: output does not match submission\noctave --quiet --eval  &quot;challenge(&#39;100&#39;,0); quit;&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1\n</pre>\n\n<p>You entry has timed out (the results will not be reported). The reason you are seeing this error message is because Octave has received an interrupt signal from the VM and is attempting to save the current state of the workspace into a file. Currently, this prevents our monitoring software from proceeding with the standard &#39;time-out&#39; message. In order to avoid this behaviour, please add the following lines of code to the top of your &#39;challenge.m&#39; file:</p>\n\n<pre>[~,config]=wfdloadlib; %You may have this line already\nif(config.inOctave)\ncrash_dumps_octave_core(0);\nend\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Where can I find more training data to test my algorithm ? </strong></p>\n\n<p>The datasets from Phase I and Phase II are a subset of the dataset of Phase III. Therefore, it is not possible to expand the training records by opening the Phase I and II datasets. You can use any data available at PhysioNet to expand your training records, the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/cgi-bin/pbs/pbsearch\">pbsearch</a> tool should help with quickly identifying records of interest. For example, ANDing all the BP, ECG, and human annotated records can be found <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/example-search.txt\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are the records and header files loaded in the testing environment ? </strong></p>\n\n<p>The *.dat and *.hea files used for generating the scoring on the VM are loaded into the top directory of the unzipped entry location. These files are *not* loaded into the &#39;./challenge/2014/set-p/&#39; directory (where the user submitted annotation files reside). Therefore, to read the data files correctly, please make sure your entry has either just the record name, or the full path to the record. For example, reading a data file from Octave, either of these methods should work (assuming challenge.m resides on the top directory of your unzipped entry file):</p>\n\n<pre>%Method 1:\nrecordName=&#39;100&#39;;\n[tm,sig]=rdsamp(recordName);\n\n%Method 2: Using full path to record file\nrecordName=&#39;100&#39;;\nrecordPath=[pwd &#39;/&#39;];\n[tm,sig]=rdsamp([recordPath recordName]);\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>How can I quickly load WFDB record data into Octave ? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Is there an alternative to RDSAMP.m for quickly loading signal data into Octave ? When I try to use RDSAMP, Octave takes a few seconds to load individual data into the workspace, is there a faster way?</p>\n\n<p>You can use the WFDB2MAT command in order to convert the record data into a *.mat file, which can then be loaded into Octave&#39;s workspace using the LOAD command. This sequence of procedures is quicker (by several orders of magnitude) than calling RDSAMP. For example, assuming that WFDB2MAT is properly installed on your system (like in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/sandbox/binary.hybrid.iso\">Sandbox bootable ISO</a>), and that the record files 100.dat and 100.hea are in the current directory:</p>\n\n<pre>%Generate the 100m.mat and 100m.hea fiels from the *.dat and *.hea files\nsystem(&#39;wfdb2mat -r 100 -H&#39;);\n%Load the new file into Octave&#39;s workspace. This will create a &#39;val&#39; variable containing the data\nload(&#39;100m&#39;);\n</pre>\n\n<p>Note that this will load the signal data in raw units. To convert from raw units to physical units you will need to follow the instructions described when running this command (ie, subtract the given &#39;base&#39; of a signal and divide by the given &#39;gain&#39; of that signal).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What were the changes to the scoring system? </strong></p>\n\n<p>The scoring interface to the 2014 PhysioNet Challenge has been re-opened for scoring on January 23, 2015. If you entry takes more than 12 hours to score please contact us. Please note carefully the following editions:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The original <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2014/set-p/\">training set</a> has been augmented with <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2014/training.zip\">100 records</a> from the original test set. Thus a new test, of 200 records, has been created that does not include these newly released records (the original test set had 300 records).</li>\n\t<li>Your scores will be calculated on this new test set of 200 records. When reporting your scores for the special issue on Physiological Measurement, please use the scores obtained from the new test set. In most cases, they will be higher than those generated based on the old test set.</li>\n\t<li>There will be a limit of 20 entries that can be scored between now and February 27, 2015. After this date, we will change this limit to a small fixed number of entries per month.</li>\n\t<li>Entries were previously limited to 40 seconds of runtime per record and total time of about 3 hours. This has been changed. Entries are now limited to 6*10^10 CPU instructions per record and the total time limit has been removed. Entries that were able to complete within 40 seconds should finish within this limit, feedback statistics on the number on the number of CPU instructions used by your entry is provided via the web interface.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Challenge Results</h3>\n\n<p>The top results of the follow-up entries as well as all entries from phases I-III (at the end of February 2015) were achieved by <strong><em>Urska Pangerc (93.64), Alistair Johnson (91.50), Sachin Vernekar (90.97), Christoph Hoog Antink (90.70), and Abid Rahman (90.16)</em></strong>.

    "full_description": "<p>Introduction</p>\n\n<p>The 2015 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge aims to encourage the development of algorithms to reduce the incidence of false alarms in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). False alarms in the ICU can lead to a disruption of care, impacting both the patient and the clinical staff through noise disturbances, desensitization to warnings and slowing of response times [1], leading to decreased quality of care [2,3]. ICU alarms produce sound intensities above 80 dB that can lead to sleep deprivation [1,4,5], inferior sleep structure [6,7], stress for both patients and staff [10,11,12,13] and depressed immune systems [14]. There are also indications that the incidence of re-hospitalization is lower if disruptive noise levels are decreased during a patient&#39;s stay [15]. Furthermore, such disruptions have been shown to have an important effect on recovery and length of stay [2,10]. In particular, cortisol levels have been shown to be elevated (reflecting increased stress) [12,13], and sleep disruption has been shown to lead to longer stays in the ICU [5]. ICU false alarm (FA) rates as high as 86% have been reported, with between 6% and 40% of ICU alarms having been shown to be true but clinically insignificant (requiring no immediate action) [16]. In fact, only 2% to 9% of alarms have been found to be important for patient management [17].</p>\n\n<p>In this challenge we focus only on life threatening arrhythmias, namely asystole, extreme bradycardia, extreme tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular flutter/fibrillation (Table 1). Entrants are encouraged to review previous and related work on this topic [18-27] and to identify key issues that have arisen in this topic in the past.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<caption><strong>Table 1:</strong> Definition of the 5 alarm types used in this challenge.</caption>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Asystole</th>\n\t\t\t<td>No QRS for at least 4 seconds</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Extreme Bradycardia</th>\n\t\t\t<td>Heart rate lower than 40 bpm for 5 consecutive beats</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Extreme Tachycardia</th>\n\t\t\t<td>Heart rate higher than 140 bpm for 17 consecutive beats</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Ventricular Tachycardia</th>\n\t\t\t<td>5 or more ventricular beats with heart rate higher than 100 bpm</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Ventricular Flutter/Fibrillation</th>\n\t\t\t<td>Fibrillatory, flutter, or oscillatory waveform for at least 4 seconds</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Quick Start</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Download the training set: <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/training.zip\">training.zip</a> and the sample MATLAB entry: <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/entry.zip\">entry.zip</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Create a free <a href=\"https://physionet.org/users/\">PhysioNetWorks</a> account and join the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/works/PhysioNetCinCChallenge2015\">PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2015</a> project.</li>\n\t<li>Develop your entry by making the following edits to entry.zip:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Modify the sample entry source code file challenge.m with your changes and improvements.

Please select &quot;PhysioNet/CinC Challenge&quot; as the topic of your abstract, so it can be identified easily by the abstract review committee. You will be notified if your abstract has been accepted by email from CinC during the first week in June.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a full (4-page) paper on your work on the Challenge to CinC no later than <strong>1 September 2015</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Attend <a href=\"http://cinc2015.org\">CinC 2015</a> (<strong>7-10 September 2015</strong>) and present your work there.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please do not submit analysis of this year&#39;s Challenge data to other conferences or journals until after CinC 2015 has taken place, so the competitors are able to discuss the results in a single forum. We expect a special issue from the journal <em>Physiological Measurement</em> to follow the conference and encourage all entrants (and those who missed the opportunity to compete or attend CinC 2015) to submit extended analyses and articles to that issue, taking into account the publications and discussions at CinC 2015.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Data</h3>\n\n<p>Bedside monitor data leading up to a total of 1250 life-threatening arrhythmia alarms recorded from three of the largest intensive care monitor manufacturers&#39; bedside units will be used in this challenge. Data are sourced from four hospitals in the USA and Europe, chosen at random (and so do not necessarily represent the true statistics for false alarm rates for any given manufacturer or hospital which is likely to be different based on unit-specific protocols, software versions and unit types). The training and test sets have each been divided into two subsets of mutually exclusive patient populations. The training set contains 750 recordings and the test set contains 500 recordings. The test is unavailable to the public and will remain private for the purpose of scoring. No more than three alarms of each of the five categories are used from any given patient, and alarms are at least 5 minutes apart (usually longer). In this way, the competition does not address the issue of what to do with repeated alarms and how to use information from earlier alarms. Although this could be done with the full files from each patient, this may also a dangerous practice, because any algorithm would propagate and compound any errors from one alarm to the next. A team of expert annotators reviewed each alarm and labeled it either &#39;true&#39;, &#39;false&#39;, or &#39;impossible to tell&#39;. The Challenge includes only records that were reviewed by at least two annotators, of whom a two-thirds majority agreed that the alarm was either true or false.</p>\n\n<p>An alarm was triggered 5 minutes from the beginning of each record. The exact time of the event that triggered the alarm varies somewhat from one record to another, but in order to meet the ANSI/AAMI EC13 Cardiac Monitor Standards [28], the onset of the event must be within 10 seconds of the alarm (i.e., between 4:50 and 5:00 of the record). Note that there may have been <em>additional</em> arrhythmia events in the 5 minutes preceding the alarm; these events have not been annotated.</p>\n\n<p>In the &quot;real-time&quot; subset, each record is exactly five minutes long, so your program does not have any information beyond what was known to the monitor at the time the alarm was triggered. In the &quot;retrospective&quot; subset (50% of the training set), each record contains an additional 30 seconds of data following the time of the alarm. All entries are assumed to be competing in the &quot;real-time&quot; category only, information on how to change your entry to compete in the &quot;retrospective&quot; category, or both, please see the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/#preparing\">Preparing an entry for the challenge</a> section. If you choose to compete in both categories, your submitted entry will receive a two scores ( one for each category ). We invite competitors to try to make use of the additional information provided by the retrospective records.</p>\n\n<p>All signals have been resampled (using anti-alias filters) to 12 bit, 250 Hz and have had FIR band pass [0.05 to 40Hz] and mains notch filters applied to remove noise. Pacemaker and other nose artifacts may be present on the ECG. Pulsatile channels can suffer from movement artifact, sensor disconnects and other events (such as line flushes or coagulation in the catheter [25]). Each recording contains two ECG leads (which may or may not be the leads that triggered the alarm) and one or more pulsatile waveforms (the photoplethysmogram and/or arterial blood pressure waveform).</p>\n\n<p>We have chosen not to provide the beat markers that the bedside alarm algorithms may have used to trigger the alarm. We also note that tachycardia and bradycardia alarms have variable thresholds, which are sometimes adjusted at the bedside. We have also removed these for consistency.</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge data are provided in WFDB format with an Octave/MATLAB-compatible header. You can load the data directly using MATLAB or Octave without any special tools, but you must take care to scale it into the correct physical units. You can also use the WFDB MATLAB Toolbox function <a href=\"https://github.com/ikarosilva/wfdb-app-toolbox/blob/master/mcode/rdmat.m\">RDMAT </a>; to load data in physical units; see below.</p>\n\n<h3>Sample Submission</h3>\n\n<p>As a starting point we have provided a fairly simple algorithm (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/entry.zip\">entry.zip</a>): one which checks the quality of the blood pressure waveform, and (if it is acceptable) uses it to calculate the heart rate. If no blood pressure is available then the same process is performed on the photoplethysmogram (PPG, or pulse oximetry waveform). If the heart rate derived from the blood pressure (or PPG) is outside the (variable) range indicated by the alarm, then the alarm is suppressed. In the case of asystole, we expect our morphology based quality algorithms to report &#39;low quality&#39; on all pulse channels because no strong regular pulse is present. Therefore the asystole alarm is suppressed only if the BP or PPG quality metrics we use report a high quality value. Note that other signal quality algorithms may not respond in the same manner.</p>\n\n<p>You may want to begin with this framework, and add more intelligent approaches, or discard it completely and start from scratch. We do not provide it because it is necessarily a good approach, but simply because it is an obvious one, which uses open source software and previously described techniques. It is particularly unsuitable for VT and VF.</p>\n\n<div>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You do not need additional software beyond MATLAB to run the sample entry or enter the competition. The sample entry has not been tested in Octave. The sample entry uses one file access function, RDMAT, which reads the Challenge&#39;s binary data and scales it appropriately. Although this function is part of the <a href=\"http://physionet.org/physiotools/matlab/wfdb-app-matlab/\">WFDB Toolbox for MATLAB</a>, it has no dependencies and its most up-to-date version can be found at the WFDB Toolbox <a href=\"https://github.com/ikarosilva/wfdb-app-toolbox/blob/master/mcode/rdmat.m\">repository</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Preparing an entry for the challenge</h3>\n\n<p>To participate in the challenge, you will need to create software that is able to read the test data and output the final alarm result without user interaction in our <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/sandbox/\">test environment</a>. Two sample entries (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/entry.zip\">entry.zip</a>, written in MATLAB, and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/entry.tar.gz\">entry.tar.gz</a>, written in Perl) are available to help you get started. In addition to MATLAB, you may use any programming language (or combination of languages) supported using open source compilers or interpreters on GNU/Linux, including C, C++, Fortran, Haskell, Java, Octave, Perl, Python, and R.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>If your entry requires software that is not installed in our sandbox environment, please let us know before the end of Phase I. We will not modify the test environment after the start of Phase II of the challenge. </em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Participants should download one of the the sample entries (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/entry.tar.gz\">entry.tar.gz</a> or <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/entry.zip\">entry.zip</a>). Entries should have the exact layout of the sample entry; specifically, they must contain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>setup.sh, a bash script run once before any other code from the entry; use this to compile your code as needed</li>\n\t<li>next.sh, a bash script run once per training or test record; it should analyze the record using your code, saving the results as a <em>text file</em> for each record.</li>\n\t<li>answers.txt, a text file containing the results of running your program on each record in the training set. These results are used for validation only, not for ranking entries (see below).</li>\n\t<li>AUTHORS.txt, a plain text file listing the members of your team who contributed to your code, and their affiliations</li>\n\t<li>LICENSE.txt, a text file containing the license for your software (the default is the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\">GPL</a>). All entries are assumed to be open source and will eventually be released on PhysioNet (for closed source entries please see below).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See the comments in the sample entry&#39;s setup.sh and next.sh if you wish to learn how to customize these scripts for your entry.</p>\n\n<p>We verify that your code is working as you intended, by comparing the answers.txt file that you submit with your entry, with answers produced by your code running in our test environment using the same records. If your code passes this validation test, it is then evaluated and scored using the <em>hidden test data set</em>. The scores in the hidden data set determines the ranking of the entries and the final outcome of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the <em>required</em> components, your entry may include a file named DRYRUN. If this file is present, your entry is not evaluated using the hidden test data, and it will not be counted against your limit of entries per phase; you will receive either a confirmation of success or a diagnostic report, but no scores. Use this feature to verify that none of the required components are missing, that your setup.sh script works in the test environment, and that your next.sh script produces the expected output for the training data within the time limits.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Closed Source Entries</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although the competition is only for open source entries, we also accept the submission of closed-source entries from industry or from individuals. If you enter closed source, we will not publish your code or score (unless you specifically request that we do so). However, the default entry is open source (GPL), so you must explicitly indicate that your entry is closed source by including with your entry a file called CLOSEDSOURCE.txt and modifying LICENSE.txt accordingly. If you submit an executable, it must be compiled to run in our testing environment (Ubuntu 14.04 amd64.)</p>\n\n<p>Open source entry scores will not be posted until after the close of the Unofficial Phase, and closed source entries will not be posted. You may choose to swap between being open source or closed source at any time up to the end of the Unofficial Phase by inserting or removing the CLOSEDSOURCE.txt file with your final entry prior to the end of the Unofficial Phase.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>If your entry is properly formatted, and nothing is missing, it is tested and scored automatically, and you will receive your scores when the test is complete (depending on your entry&#39;s run time, this may take an hour or more). If you receive an error message instead, read it carefully and correct the problem(s) before resubmitting.</p>\n\n<p>The scoring for this challenge will be a function of the following variables: true positives (<strong>TP</strong>), false positives (<strong>FP</strong>), false negatives (<strong>FN</strong>), and true negatives (<strong>TN</strong>). Where these variables are defined as below:</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<caption><strong>Table 3:</strong> Scoring Statistics</caption>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Outcome</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\"><em>Gold Standard</em></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>True Alarm</td>\n\t\t\t<td>False Alarm</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Predicted</em></td>\n\t\t\t<td>True Alarm</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>TP</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>FP</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>False Alarm</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>FN</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>TN</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>More specifically, competitors should attempt to maximize <strong>TP</strong> and <strong>TN</strong> while minimizing <strong>FP</strong> and <strong>FN</strong>. The scoring will weight <strong>FN</strong> more heavily than the <strong>FP</strong>. The script score2015Challenge.m in the sample entry, <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/entry.zip\">entry.zip</a>, generates these statistics on the training set for MATLAB based entries, but does not give you a final score. The final scoring equation was not included with the sample entries because was under testing during the initial stage of the challenge. If you wish to calcualte the final score for your entry, you can do so by implementing the equation :</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Score = ( TP + TN ) / ( TP + TN + FP + 5*FN )</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Obtaining complimentary MATLAB licenses</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com\">The MathWorks</a> has kindly decided to sponsor Physionet&#39;s 2015 Challenge.

Output produced by MATLAB programs is not available (since MATLAB is not open source), and output produced from the test set is not available (since this would give away information about the hidden records.) If your entry does not use MATLAB, be sure to remove the line NEED_MATLAB=1 from setup.sh.</p>\n\n<p>If your setup.sh fails (exits with non-zero status), anything it writes to the standard output is reported and the evaluation stops. Otherwise, no output from setup.sh is reported.</p>\n\n<p>If your next.sh fails on a <em>training set record</em>, anything it writes to the standard output is reported and the evaluation stops (the remaining records are not tested). Otherwise, no output from next.sh is reported.</p>\n\n<p>If your next.sh is unable to process a <em>test set record</em> within the time limit, it will receive poor partial scores for that record, but the evaluation will continue.</p>\n\n<p>If your entry fails to process one or more test set records, or if it does not complete its analysis of one or more records within the per-record time limit, the numbers of failures and timeouts will be reported, along with the scores. <em>No other diagnostic output relating to test set records will be reported.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>May I submit a binary (executable) entry without a complete set of sources?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Entries that do not include a complete set of sources are ineligible for awards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What version of MATLAB and what MATLAB toolboxes are available in the test environment?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The test environment has MATLAB 2014b and the <a href=\"http://physionet.org/physiotools/matlab/wfdb-app-matlab/\">WFDB Toolbox for MATLAB</a> version 0.9.9. A list of installed MATLAB built-in toolboxes can be found <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/matlab-info\">here</a>. Note that you must include the line NEED_MATLAB=1 in your setup.sh if you wish to use MATLAB in your entry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If I use up all of my entries, can I register again using another email address and get more entries?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Please don&#39;t do this! The limit on the number of entries:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>is necessary in order to make it feasible to evaluate entries within a reasonable time as deadlines approach,</li>\n\t<li>reduces the opportunities for overfitting and consequent development of non-generalizable solutions, and</li>\n\t<li>is an important part of establishing a fair and level playing field for the Challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously we cannot prevent use of multiple email addresses to circumvent the limit on entries, but we consider such behavior abusive and disrespectful to other participants. If we discover that this has occurred, we will disqualify offending <em>participants</em> from this and future competitions.</p>\n\n<p>Note, however, that participants are allowed (and encouraged) to collaborate in order to combine the best features of complementary approaches. If you wish to collaborate with another participant or team of participants, each of the team members may use the remaining entries of whichever collaborative team has the most remaining entries. Other than in exception circumstances, we expect that collaborators to be unknown to each other prior to the competition, and not from the same research group or department. <em>Collaborators must be particularly careful to list all current team members in their AUTHORS files to avoid disqualification.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it worth analyzing the ECG?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Possibly. The monitors have excellent ECG analysis algorithms, but do not necessarily make use of all the information available. However, you may choose to use information in the ECG if you like. Be careful, though, as the signal may contain significant artifacts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the alarm labels used for the 5 alarms? How are the alarms coded?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The alarms are coded using case sensitive strings in the following manner:</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<caption>Alarm Coding Strings</caption>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Alarm Type</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Coding String</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Asystole</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Asystole</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Extreme Bradycardia</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Bradycardia</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Extreme Tachycardia</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Tachycardia</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Ventricular Tachycardia</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Ventricular_Tachycardia</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Ventricular Flutter/Fibrillation</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Ventricular_Flutter_Fib</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Challenge Results</h3>\n\n<p>Listed below are the top-scoring programs submitted in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2015/\">PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2015</a>.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>The 2016 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge aims to encourage the development of algorithms to classify heart sound recordings collected from a variety of clinical or nonclinical (such as in-home visits) environments. The aim is to identify, from a single short recording (10-60s) from a single precordial location, whether the subject of the recording should be referred on for an expert diagnosis.</p>\n\n<p>During the cardiac cycle, the heart firstly generates the electrical activity and then the electrical activity causes atrial and ventricular contractions. This in turn forces blood between the chambers of the heart and around the body. The opening and closure of the heart valves is associated with accelerations-decelerations of blood, giving rise to vibrations of the entire cardiac structure (the heart sounds and murmurs) [1]. These vibrations are audible at the chest wall, and listening for specific heart sounds can give an indication of the health of the heart. The phonocardiogram (PCG) is the graphical representation of a heart sound recording. <strong>Figure 1</strong> illustrates a short section of a PCG recording.</p>\n\n<p>Four locations are most often used to listen to the heart sounds, which are named according to the positions where the valves can be best heard:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Aortic area - centered at the second right intercostal space.</li>\n\t<li>Pulmonic area - in the second intercostal space along the left sternal border.</li>\n\t<li>Tricuspid area - in the fourth intercostal space along the left sternal edge.</li>\n\t<li>Mitral area - at the cardiac apex, in the fifth intercostal space on the midclavicular line.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Fundamental heart sounds (FHSs) usually include the first (S1) and second (S2) heart sounds. S1 occurs at the beginning of isovolumetric ventricular contraction, when the mitral and tricuspid valves close due to the rapid increase in pressure within the ventricles. S2 occurs at the beginning of diastole with the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. While the FHSs are the most recognizable sounds of the heart cycle, the mechanical activity of the heart may also cause other audible sounds, such as the third heart sound (S3), the fourth heart sound (S4), systolic ejection click (EC), mid-systolic click (MC), diastolic sound or opening snap (OS), as well as heart murmurs caused by the turbulent, high-velocity flow of blood.</p>\n\n<p>The segmentation of the FHSs is a first step in the automatic analysis of heart sounds. The accurate localization of the FHSs is a prerequisite for the identification of the systolic or diastolic regions, allowing the subsequent classification of pathological situations in these regions [2]. Challenge participants could refer to the literature [3-10] for a quick review of previously developed segmentation methods.</p>\n\n<p>The automated classification of pathology in heart sound recordings has been performed for over 50 years, but still presents challenges. Gerbarg et al were the first researchers to attempt the automatic classification of pathology in PCGs using a threshold-based method [11], motivated by the need to identify children with rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been the most widely used machine learning-based approach for heart sound classification. Typical relevant studies grouped by the signal features as the input to the ANN classifier include: using wavelet features [12], time, frequency and complexity-based features [13], and time-frequency features [14]. A number of researchers have also applied support vector machines (SVM) for heart sound classification in recent years. The studies can also be divided according to the feature extraction methods, including wavelet [15], time, frequency and time-frequency feature-based classifiers [16]. Hidden Markov models (HMM) have also been employed for pathology classification in PCG recordings [17,18]. Clustering-based classifiers, typically the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm [19,20], have also been employed to classify pathology in PGCs. In addition, many other techniques have been applied, including threshold-based methods, decision trees [21], discriminant function analysis [22,23] and logistic regression.</p>\n\n<p>Although a number of the current studies for heart sound classification are flawed because of 1) good performance on carefully-selected data, 2) lack of a separate test dataset, 3) failure to use a variety of PCG recordings, or 4) validation only on clean recordings, these methods have demonstrated potential to accurately detect pathology in PCG recordings. In this Challenge, we will focus only on the accurate classification of normal and abnormal heart sounds, especially when some heart sounds exhibit very poor signal quality. The Challenge provides the largest public collection of PCG recordings from a variety of clinical and nonclinical environments, permitting challengers to develop accurate and robust algorithms.</p>\n\n<h3>Quick Start</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Download the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2016/validation.zip\">validation set</a> and the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2016/sample2016.zip\">sample MATLAB entry</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Create a free <a href=\"https://physionet.org/users/\">PhysioNetWorks</a> account and join the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/works/PhysioNetCinCChallenge2016\">PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016</a> project.</li>\n\t<li>Develop your entry by editing the existing files:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Modify the sample entry source code file <code>challenge.m</code> with your changes and improvements.

We expect a special issue from the journal <em>Physiological Measurement</em> to follow the conference and encourage all entrants (and those who missed the opportunity to compete or attend CinC 2016) to submit extended analyses and articles to that issue, taking into account the publications and discussions at CinC 2016.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Data</h3>\n\n<p>Heart sound recordings were sourced from several contributors around the world, collected at either a clinical or nonclinical environment, from both healthy subjects and pathological patients. The Challenge training set consists of five databases (A through E) containing a total of 3,126 heart sound recordings, lasting from 5 seconds to just over 120 seconds. You can <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2016/\">browse these files</a>, or <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2016/training.zip\">download the entire training set as a zip archive (169 MB)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In each of the databases, each record begins with the same letter followed by a sequential, but random number. Files from the same patient are unlikely to be numerically adjacent. The training and test sets have each been divided so that they are two sets of mutually exclusive populations (i.e., no recordings from the same subject/patient were are in both training and test sets). Moreover, there are two data sets that have been placed exclusively in either the training or test databases (to ensure there are &lsquo;novel&rsquo; recording types and to reduce overfitting on the recording methods). Both the training set and the test set may be enriched after the close of the unofficial phase. The test set is unavailable to the public and will remain private for the purpose of scoring.</p>\n\n<p>Participants may note the existence of a validation dataset in the data folder. This data is a copy of 300 records from the training set, and will be used to validate entries before their evaluation on the test set. More detail will be provided in the scoring section below.</p>\n\n<p>The heart sound recordings were collected from different locations on the body. The typical four locations are aortic area, pulmonic area, tricuspid area and mitral area, but could be one of nine different locations. In both training and test sets, heart sound recordings were divided into two types: normal and abnormal heart sound recordings. The normal recordings were from healthy subjects and the abnormal ones were from patients with a confirmed cardiac diagnosis. The patients suffer from a variety of illnesses (which we do not provide on a case-by-case basis), but typically they are heart valve defects and coronary artery disease patients. Heart valve defects include mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis and valvular surgery. All the recordings from the patients were generally labeled as abnormal. We do not provide more specific classification for these abnormal recordings. Please note that both training and test sets are unbalanced, i.e., the number of normal recordings does not equal that of abnormal recordings. You will have to consider this when you train and test your algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>Both healthy subjects and pathological patients include both children and adults. Each subject/patient may have contributed between one and six heart sound recordings. The recordings last from several seconds to up to more than one hundred seconds. All recordings have been resampled to 2,000 Hz and have been provided as .wav format. Each recording contains only one PCG lead.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that due to the uncontrolled environment of the recordings, many recordings are corrupted by various noise sources, such as talking, stethoscope motion, breathing and intestinal sounds. Some recordings were difficult or even impossible to classify as normal or abnormal. Therefore we have given the challengers the choice to classify some recordings as &lsquo;unsure&rsquo; and we penalize this in a different manner. Therefore, your classifications for the heart sound recordings could be three types: normal, abnormal and unsure (too noisy to know). The detailed scoring mechanism could be found in <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2016/#scoring\">Scoring</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> A paper to provide a detailed description of all the heart sound data in PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016 is expected to appear in the Journal Physiological Measurement on or about July 2016. We will post a preprint of it on this site soon to help you understand the Challenge more thoroughly and may help in improving your submitted algorithms in the Official Phase.</p>\n\n<h3>Sample Submission</h3>\n\n<p>As a starting point, we have provided an example entry (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2016/sample2016.zip\">sample2016.zip</a>), implemented using Matlab, which provides state of the art segmentation and rudimentary classification. This code first segments the heart sounds using Springer&rsquo;s improved version of Schmidt&rsquo;s method [5,9], which uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that has been trained (using database &lsquo;a&rsquo; of the training set) to identify four &lsquo;states&rsquo;; S1, S2, systole and diastole. Thereafter, 20 features are extracted from the timings of the states and a logistic regression classifier (again, trained on database &lsquo;a&rsquo; of the training data) provides the classification of the recording as normal or abnormal. For more information about this algorithm, see the released <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/hss/\">Logistic Regression-HSMM-based Heart Sound Segmentation</a> software package on PhysioToolkit. Also see the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/works/LogisticRegressionHSMMbasedHeartSoundSegmentation/\">PhysionetWorks</a> page where the software package is being developed.</p>\n\n<p>A simpler version of this code (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2016/sample2016b.zip\">sample2016b.zip</a>), using Schmidt&#39;s original algorithm, is faster and works in GNU Octave as well as in Matlab.</p>\n\n<p>You may want to begin with this framework, and add more intelligent approaches, or discard it completely and start from scratch. The features and classifier are not necessarily recommended and they are only provided as an example benchmark approach. The beat segmentation algorithm is, however, state of the art. We therefore suggest you concentrate on adapting this to provide better features. Note also that we have not optimized the training of either the HMM, the features chosen or selected, the splitting of the data, or the classifier. We suggest you consider these issues carefully.</p>\n\n<h3>Preparing an entry for the challenge</h3>\n\n<p>To participate in the challenge, you will need to create software that is able to read the test data and output the final classification result without user interaction in our <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/sandbox/\">test environment</a>. A sample entry (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2016/sample2016.zip\">sample2016.zip</a>), written in MATLAB, is available to help you get started. In addition to MATLAB, you may use any programming language (or combination of languages) supported using open-source compilers or interpreters on GNU/Linux, including C, C++, Fortran, Haskell, Java, Octave, Perl, Python, and R.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>If your entry requires software that is not installed in our sandbox environment, please let us know before the end of Phase I. We will not modify the test environment after the start of Phase II of the challenge. </em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Your entry must be in the format of a <code>zip</code> or <code>tar.gz</code> archive, containing the following files:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>setup.sh</code>, a <code>bash</code> script run once before any other code from the entry; use this to compile your code as needed</li>\n\t<li><code>next.sh</code>, a <code>bash</code> script run once per training or test record; it should analyze the record using your code, writing the results to the file <code>answers.txt</code>.</li>\n\t<li><code>answers.txt</code>, a text file containing the results of running your program on each record in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2016/validation/\">validation set</a>. These results are used for checking that your program is working correctly, not for ranking entries (see below).</li>\n\t<li><code>AUTHORS.txt</code>, a plain text file listing the members of your team who contributed to your code, and their affiliations.</li>\n\t<li><code>LICENSE.txt</code>, a text file containing the license for your software. The sample entry is licensed under the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\">GNU GPL</a>. All entries are assumed to be open source and will eventually be released on PhysioNet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See the comments in the sample entry&#39;s <code>setup.sh</code> and <code>next.sh</code> if you wish to learn how to customize these scripts for your entry.</p>\n\n<p>We verify that your code is working as you intended, by running it on the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2016/validation/\">validation</a> set, which consists of approximately 10% of the training set. We then compare the answers produced by your code with the contents of the <code>answers.txt</code> file that you submit as part of your entry. Using a small portion of the training set means you will know whether your code passed or failed to run in approximately an hour or less. If your code passes this validation test, it is then evaluated and scored using an approximately representative 20% of the hidden test set. By selecting a random 20% subset of the test set, not only do you receive your score in a more timely manner, but it also prevents you from over-fitting on the test data through multiple entries. Towards the end of the official phase we will run your code on increasingly larger portions of the test set. The score on the complete test set determines the ranking of the entries and the final outcome of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the <em>required</em> components, your entry may include a file named <code>DRYRUN</code>. If this file is present, your entry is not evaluated using the hidden test data, and it will not be counted against your limit of entries per phase; you will receive either a confirmation of success or a diagnostic report, but no scores. Use this feature to verify that none of the required components are missing, that your <code>setup.sh</code> script works in the test environment, and that your <code>next.sh</code> script produces the expected output for the training data within the time limits.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>If your entry is properly formatted, and nothing is missing, it is tested and scored automatically, and you will receive your provisional scores when the test is complete (this will take several hours, depending on how complex your entry is). If you receive an error message instead, read it carefully and correct the problem(s) before resubmitting.</p>\n\n<p>The overall score for your entry is computed based on the number of records classified as normal, uncertain, or abnormal, in each of the reference categories. These numbers are denoted by <span>Nnk</span>, <span>Nqk</span>, <span>Nak</span>, <span>Ank</span>, <span>Aqk</span>, <span>Aak</span>, as follows:</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Entry&#39;s output</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Normal (-1)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Uncertain (0)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Abnormal (1)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Reference label</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>Normal, clean</td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>Nn1</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>Nq1</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>Na1</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Normal, noisy</td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>Nn2</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>Nq2</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>Na2</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Abnormal, clean</td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>An1</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>Aq1</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>Aa1</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Abnormal, noisy</td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>An2</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>Aq2</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td><span>Aa2</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Weights for the various categories are defined as follows (based on the distribution of the <em>complete</em> test set):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div>wa1 = clean abnormal records / total abnormal records</div>\n\n<div>wa2 = noisy abnormal records / total abnormal records</div>\n\n<div>wn1 = clean normal records / total normal records</div>\n\n<div>wn2 = noisy normal records / total normal records</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The modified sensitivity and specificity are defined (based on a <em>subset</em> of the test set):</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div>Se = wa1\u2062Aa1 / (Aa1+Aq1+An1) + wa2(\u2062Aa2+Aq2) / (Aa2+Aq2+An2)</div>\n\n<div>Sp = wn1 \u2062Nn1 / (Na1+Nq1+Nn1) + wn2 \u2062(Nn2 +Nq2) / (Na2+Nq2+Nn2)</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The overall score is then the average of these two values, <span>(Se+Sp)/2</span>.</p>\n\n<h3>Obtaining complimentary MATLAB licenses</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com\">The MathWorks</a> has kindly decided to sponsor Physionet&#39;s 2016 Challenge both through additional prize money for the winners and through complimentary licenses for Challenge participants for the duration of the Challenge.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>The 2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge aims to encourage the development of algorithms to classify, from a single short ECG lead recording (between 30 s and 60 s in length), whether the recording shows normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation (AF), an alternative rhythm, or is too noisy to be classified.</p>\n\n<p>There are various types of cardiac arrhythmias that may be classified by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Origin: atrial arrhythmia, junctional arrhythmia, or ventricular arrhythmia.</li>\n\t<li>Rate: tachycardia ( &gt; 100 beats per minute (bpm) in adults) or bradycardia ( &lt; 60 bpm in adults).</li>\n\t<li>Mechanism: automaticity, re-entry, triggered.</li>\n\t<li>AV Conduction: normal, delayed, blocked.</li>\n\t<li>Duration: non-sustained (less than 30 s) or sustained (30 s or longer).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>AF is defined as a &ldquo;tachyarrhythmia characterized by predominantly uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function&rdquo; by the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref1\">1</a>]. AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, occurring in 1-2% of the general population [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref2\">2</a>; <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref3\">3</a>] and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity through association of risk of death, stroke, hospitalization, heart failure and coronary artery disease, etc. [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref3\">3</a>; <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref4\">4</a>]. More than 12 million Europeans and North Americans are estimated to suffer from AF, and its prevalence will likely triple in the next 30-50 years [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref5\">5</a>]. More importantly, the incidence of AF increases with age, from less than 0.5% at 40-50 years of age, to 5-15% for 80 year olds [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref6\">6</a>].</p>\n\n<p>Despite the enormity of this problem, AF detection remains problematic, because it may be episodic. AF detectors can be thought of belonging to one of two categories: atrial activity analysis-based or ventricular response analysis-based methods. Atrial activity analysis-based AF detectors are based on the analysis of the absence of P waves or the presence of fibrillatory <em>f waves</em> in the TQ interval. Published methods to do this include: an echo state neural network [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref7\">7</a>], P-wave absence (PWA) based detection [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref8\">8</a>], analysis of the average number of f waves [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref9\">9</a>], P-wave-based insertable cardiac monitor application [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref10\">10</a>], wavelet entropy [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref11\">11</a>] [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref12\">12</a>] and wavelet energy [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref13\">13</a>]. Atrial activity analysis-based AF detectors can achieve high accuracy if the recorded ECG signals have little noise contamination and high resolution, but tend to suffer disproportionately from noise contamination [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref4\">4</a>]. In contrast, ventricular response analysis is based on the predictability of the inter-beat timing (&lsquo;RR intervals&rsquo;) of the QRS complexes in the ECG. RR intervals are derived from the most obvious large amplitude feature in the ECG, the R-peak, the detection of which can be far more noise resistant. This approach may therefore be more suitable for automatic, real-time AF detection [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref14\">14</a>]. Published methods include: Poincar&eacute; plot analysis [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref15\">15</a>], Lorenz plot analysis [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref16\">16</a>], analysis of cumulative distribution functions [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref17\">17</a>], thresholding on the median absolute deviation (MAD) of RR intervals [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref18\">18</a>], histogram of the first difference of RR intervals [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref19\">19</a>], minimum of the corrected conditional entropy of RR interval sequence [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref20\">20</a>], 8-beat sliding window RR interval irregularity detector [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref21\">21</a>], symbolic dynamics and Shannon entropy [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref22\">22</a>], sample entropy of RR intervals [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref23\">23</a>; <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref24\">24</a>; <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref25\">25</a>], and normalized fuzzy entropy of RR intervals [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref26\">26</a>].</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that AF detectors that combine both atrial activity and ventricular response could provide an enhanced performance by combining independent data from each part of the cardiac cycle. Such detection approaches have included: RR interval Markov modeling combined with PR interval variability and a P wave morphology similarity measure [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref27\">27</a>] and a fuzzy logic classification method which uses the combination of RR interval irregularity, P-wave absence, f-wave presence, and noise level [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref28\">28</a>]. It is also worth noting that multivariate approaches based on machine learning that combines several of the above single features can also provide enhanced AF detection [<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref29\">29</a>; <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref30\">30</a>; <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#ref31\">31</a>].</p>\n\n<p>Previous studies concerning AF classification are generally limited in applicability because 1) only classification of normal and AF rhythms were performed, 2) good performance was shown on carefully-selected often clean data, 3) a separate out of sample test dataset was not used, or 4) only a small number of patients were used. It is challenging to reliably detect AF from a single short lead of ECG, and the broad taxonomy of rhythms makes this particularly difficult. In particular, many non-AF rhythms exhibit irregular RR intervals that may be similar to AF. In this Challenge, we treat all non-AF abnormal rhythms as a single class and require the Challenge entrant to classify the rhythms as 1) Normal sinus rhythm, 2) AF, 3) Other rhythm, or 4) Too noisy to classify.</p>\n\n<h3>Quick Start</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Download the training set: <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/training2017.zip\"><code>training2017.zip</code></a> and the sample MATLAB entry: <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/sample2017.zip\"><code>sample2017.zip</code></a>.</li>\n\t<li>Create a free <a href=\"https://physionet.org/users/login.shtml\">PhysioNetWorks</a> account and join the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/works/PhysioNetCinCChallenge2017/\">PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017</a> project.</li>\n\t<li>Develop your entry by making the following edits to <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/sample2017.zip\"><code>sample2017.zip</code></a>:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Modify the sample entry source code file <code>challenge.m</code> with your changes and improvements.

Each participant may receive scores for up to five entries submitted during the unofficial phase and ten entries at the end of the official phase. Unused entries may not be carried over to later phases. Entries that cannot be scored (because of missing components, improper formatting, or excessive run time) are not counted against the entry limits.</p>\n\n<p>All deadlines occur at noon GMT (UTC) on the dates mentioned below. If you do not know the difference between GMT and your local time, find out what it is <em>before</em> the deadline!</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<caption><strong>Table 1:</strong> Rules and deadlines.</caption>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>&nbsp;</th>\n\t\t\t<th><em>Start at noon GMT on</em></th>\n\t\t\t<th><em>Entry limit</em></th>\n\t\t\t<th><em>End at noon GMT on</em></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th><strong>Unofficial Phase</strong></th>\n\t\t\t<td>1 February</td>\n\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>9 April</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>[Hiatus]</th>\n\t\t\t<td>9 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>0</td>\n\t\t\t<td>16 April</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th><strong>Official Phase</strong></th>\n\t\t\t<td>16 April</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1 September</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>All official entries must be received no later than <strong>noon GMT on Friday, 1 September 2017</strong>. In the interest of fairness to all participants, late entries will not be accepted or scored. Entries that cannot be scored (because of missing components, improper formatting, or excessive run time) are not counted against the entry limits.</p>\n\n<p>To be eligible for the <strong>open-source award</strong>, you must do all of the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Submit at least one open-source entry that can be scored before the Phase I deadline <strong>(noon GMT on Sunday, 9 April 2017)</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Submit at least one entry during the second phase <strong>(between noon GMT on Sunday, 16 April 2017 and noon GMT on Friday, 1 September 2017)</strong>. <em>Only your final entry will count for ranking.</em></li>\n\t<li><strong>Entering an Abstract to CinC</strong>: Submit an acceptable abstract (about 299 words) on your work on the Challenge to <a href=\"https://www.softconf.com/i/cinc2017/\">Computing in Cardiology</a> no later than <strong>15 April 2017</strong>. Include the overall score for at least one Phase I entry in your abstract. Please select &ldquo;PhysioNet/CinC Challenge&rdquo; as the topic of your abstract, so it can be identified easily by the abstract review committee. You will be notified if your abstract has been accepted by email from CinC during the first week in June.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a full (4-page) paper on your work on the Challenge to CinC no later than the deadline of conference paper submission.</li>\n\t<li>Attend CinC 2017 (<strong>24&ndash;27 September 2017</strong>) in Rennes, France and present your work there.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please do not submit analysis of this year&rsquo;s Challenge data to other Conferences or Journals until after CinC 2017 has taken place, so the competitors are able to discuss the results in a single forum. We expect a special issue from the journal <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334\"><em>Physiological Measurement</em></a> to follow the conference and encourage all entrants (and those who missed the opportunity to compete or attend CinC 2017) to submit extended analysis and articles to that issue, taking into account the publications and discussions at CinC 2017.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Data</h3>\n\n<p>ECG recordings, collected using the AliveCor device, were generously donated for this Challenge by AliveCor. The training set contains 8,528 single lead ECG recordings lasting from 9 s to just over 60 s (see <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#table2\">Table 2</a>) and the test set contains 3,658 ECG recordings of similar lengths. The test set is unavailable to the public and will remain private for the purpose of scoring for the duration of the Challenge and for some period afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>ECG recordings were sampled as 300 Hz and they have been band pass filtered by the AliveCor device. All data are provided in MATLAB V4 WFDB-compliant format (each including a .mat file containing the ECG and a .hea file containing the waveform information). More details of the training set can be seen in <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#table2\">Table 2</a>. <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#figure1\">Figure 1</a> shows the examples of the ECG waveforms (lasting for 20 s) for the four classes in this Challenge. From top to bottom, they are ECG waveforms of normal rhythm, AF rhythm, other rhythm and noisy recordings.</p>\n\n<p><em>Please note, since all the classification was performed by a single expert, we are currently in the process of re-scoring a subset where our trust of the data is lowest. We will almost certainly update labels on some of data in both the training and test databases. We may also add new data in the future, although this is unlikely to change after we begin the official phase of the competition.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Please also note that the scoring system currently treats all classes equally. It is likely we will update this for the official phase also. The point of the unnofficial phase is for us to iron out bugs in the competition, and you are a vital part of that. Please send us suggestions/queries to <a href=\"mailto:challenge@physionet.org\">challenge@physionet.org</a>. We welcome suggestions for reclassifying a file, but please provide your reasoning. </em></p>\n\n<p>We strongly suggest you use the Google group public forum to ask questions unless you are asking us a question that is specific to your entry only and would reveal your methods to others. In general we post answers to the Google group to provide a level playing field.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that we are all volunteers with finite bandwidth, so we prioritize our responses and often discuss them as a group first. Inevitably some emails will have a response delay or may even slip through the net.</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<caption><strong>Table 2:</strong> Data profile for the training set.</caption>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th rowspan=\"2\">Type</th>\n\t\t\t<th rowspan=\"2\"># recording</th>\n\t\t\t<th colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Time length (s)</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Mean</th>\n\t\t\t<th>SD</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Max</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Median</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Min</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Normal</th>\n\t\t\t<td>5154</td>\n\t\t\t<td>31.9</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10.0</td>\n\t\t\t<td>61.0</td>\n\t\t\t<td>30</td>\n\t\t\t<td>9.0</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>AF</th>\n\t\t\t<td>771</td>\n\t\t\t<td>31.6</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12.5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>60</td>\n\t\t\t<td>30</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10.0</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Other rhythm</th>\n\t\t\t<td>2557</td>\n\t\t\t<td>34.1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>11.8</td>\n\t\t\t<td>60.9</td>\n\t\t\t<td>30</td>\n\t\t\t<td>9.1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Noisy</th>\n\t\t\t<td>46</td>\n\t\t\t<td>27.1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>9.0</td>\n\t\t\t<td>60</td>\n\t\t\t<td>30</td>\n\t\t\t<td>10.2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th><strong>Total</strong></th>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>8528</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>32.5</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>10.9</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>61.0</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>30</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>9.0</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>.

We note that this detector provides a classification of only Normal or AF rhythms. We leave it to the Challengers to add the other classes.</p>\n\n<p>You may want to begin with the sample detector, or discard it completely and start from scratch using more data-driven or physiological model-based approaches. Please note that the sample entry has been patented by their original authors and, although we provide an open source version of it for benchmarking, you should not hope to create intellectual property from derivatives of it. We therefore suggest you concentrate on developing alternative methods to this benchmark.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You do not need any additional software, apart from Matlab or GNU Octave, to run the sample entry. You can use any programming languages or libraries you like when implementing your own submission.</p>\n\n<h3>Preparing an entry for the challenge</h3>\n\n<p>To participate in the challenge, you will need to create software that is able to read the test data and output the final classification result without user interaction in our test environment. One sample entry (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/sample2017.zip\"><code>sample2017.zip</code></a>, written in MATLAB) is available to help you get started. In addition to MATLAB, you may use any programming language (or combination of languages) supported using open source compilers or interpreters on GNU/Linux, including C, C++, Fortran, Haskell, Java, Octave, Perl, Python, and R.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>If your entry requires software that is not installed in our sandbox environment, we will work with you during Phase I to try to ensure your code can run. We will not modify the test environment after the start of Phase II of the challenge.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Participants should download the sample entry (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/sample2017.zip\"><code>sample2017.zip</code></a>). Entries should have the exact layout of the sample entry; specifically, they must contain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>setup.sh</code>, a bash script runs once before any other code from the entry; use this to compile your code as needed.</li>\n\t<li><code>next.sh</code>, a bash script runs once per training or test record; it should analyze the record using your code, saving the results as a text file for each record.</li>\n\t<li><code>dependencies.txt</code>, a text file that lists additional Debian packages that must be installed prior to running your entry&rsquo;s <code>setup.sh</code> and <code>next.sh</code> scripts.</li>\n\t<li><code>answers.txt</code>, a text file containing the results of running your program on each record in the validation set (part of training set, see below for details). These results are used for validation only, not for ranking entries.</li>\n\t<li><code>AUTHORS.txt</code>, a plain text file listing the members of your team who contributed to your code, and their affiliations.</li>\n\t<li><code>LICENSE.txt</code>, a text file containing the license for your software (the default is the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\">GPL</a>). All entries are assumed to be open source and will eventually be released on PhysioNet (for closed source entries please see below).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See the comments in the sample entry&rsquo;s <code>setup.sh</code> and <code>next.sh</code> if you wish to learn how to customize these scripts for your entry.</p>\n\n<p>We verify that your code is working as you intended, by running it on a small subset (validation set, 300 recordings) of the training set, then comparing the <code>answers.txt</code> file that you submit with your entry with answers produced by your code running in our test environment using the same records. Using a small portion of the training set means you will know whether your code passed or failed to run within a small time. If your code passes this validation test, it is then evaluated and scored using the hidden test set. The score in the hidden test set determines the ranking of the entries and the final outcome of the Challenge. Note that in the Official Phase of the challenge, more data may be added to both training and hidden test set. Your final entry in the Official Phase of the competition will be run on the entire test set, and so may take much longer than earlier entries.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the required components, your entry may include a file named <code>DRYRUN</code>. If this file is present, your entry is not evaluated using the hidden test data, and it will not be counted against your limit of entries per phase; you will receive either a confirmation of success or a diagnostic report, but no scores. Use this feature to verify that none of the required components are missing, that your <code>setup.sh</code> script works in the test environment, and that your <code>next.sh</code> script produces the expected output for the training data within the time limits.</p>\n\n<h3>Closed Source Entries</h3>\n\n<p>Although the competition is only for open source entries, we also accept the submission of closed-source entries from industry or from individuals. If you enter closed source, we will not publish your code or score (unless you specifically request that we do so). However, the default entry is open source (GPL), so you must explicitly indicate that your entry is closed source by including with your entry a file called <code>CLOSEDSOURCE.txt</code> and modifying <code>LICENSE.txt</code> accordingly. If you submit an executable, it must be compiled to run in our testing environment (Debian 8.7, amd64.)</p>\n\n<p>Open source entry scores will not be posted until after the close of the Official Phase, and closed source entries will not be posted. You may choose to swap between being open source or closed source at any time up to the end of the Unofficial Phase by inserting or removing the <code>CLOSEDSOURCE.txt</code> file with your final entry prior to the end of the Unofficial Phase.</p>\n\n<h3>More on Licences and IP</h3>\n\n<p>We would like to note that the competition does not give the company donating the data any rights to algorithms or ideas developed by competitors. Any entity is free to contact a competitor to request a license to use their code for commercial purposes. Since the competitor must use an open source license to be eligible for a prize, it may be necessary for the competitor to produce another version of the code with a different license (as copyright holders they are at liberty to do so). This would in no way influence the posting of the open source code for the Challenge or its use for research purposes.</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n\n<p>If your entry is properly formatted, and nothing is missing, it is tested and scored automatically, and you will receive your scores when the test is complete (depending on your entry&rsquo;s run time, this may take an hour or more). If you receive an error message instead, read it carefully and correct the problem(s) before resubmitting. Missing answers are treated as noise labels.</p>\n\n<p>The scoring for this challenge uses a <span>F1</span> measure, which is an average of the four <span>F1</span> values from each classification type. The counting rules for the numbers of the variables are defined in <a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/#table3\">Table 3</a> as below:</p>\n\n<table>\n\t<caption><strong>Table 3</strong>.

We will assess your performance on all of the hidden data only on your final entry in the official phase of the competition. The reason we do this is to prevent you over training on the hidden data. To improve your algorithm, you must assess your algorithm&rsquo;s performance on the training data using cross validation.</p>\n\n<p>We are arbitrarily following the olympic model (for swimming events). Anyone with exactly the same score would split the &#39;medals&#39; as normal. If two tie for gold (1st place) then we skip silver and the prize money for first and second place are divided equally between the 1st place winners. The 3rd place is awarded as normal. If three or more tie for gold then we award no other places and the entire cash prize for all three places is split equally. If any number tie for silver we skip bronze and split the silver and bronze cash prizes equally between all the 2nd place teams. If several tie for bronze then they all are awarded 3rd place share the 3rd place prize money equally.</p>\n\n<p>So if a team scored 0.95 and then two teams scored 0.91, and others scored 0.85 (say) the first prize would go to the team with 0.95 and the second place would be equally awarded to the two teams scoring 0.91. No &#39;third place&#39; team would be identified.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the third decimal place in the scoring system probably isn&#39;t statistically significant, which is why our leader board doesn&#39;t show it beyond two decimal places (like they do in olympic swimming events).</p>\n\n<h3>Abstract Submission</h3>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t forget you must also submit an abstract to Computing in Cardiology before the imminent deadline on the 15th of April and attend the conference in September where we will announce the winner. See <a href=\"http://cinc.org\">cinc.org</a>. Note that your methods and score, and therefore your abstract, will most likely change by the end of summer. That is acceptable and expected. If you don&#39;t submit now though, you won&#39;t reserve your place to discuss your methods at the conference. Please note that abstracts should include your current methods and score. We encourage you to include cross validation stats on the training data too to show the reviewers you know what you are doing. In many ways toys is far more important than your test set score we give you at this stage, so if you have a poor challenge score but a great cross validated score then you are well on your way!</p>\n\n<p>Incoherent or information poor abstracts are unlikely to be accepted as they indicate low quality approaches and an inability to communicate ideas. A well thought out abstract indicates a high likelihood of a good presentation and high quality scientific approach. Do not include a description of the competition in the abstract (it&#39;s very clear what the competition is about) ... focus on your methods and results.</p>\n\n<p>Please make sure you select the Physionet Challenge category in the abstract submission. If you don&#39;t it may get reviewed outside of the challenge track and get rejected.</p>\n\n<p>Also, please do not title your paper something similar to the challenge itself .... I&#39;ll ask you to change your title and it wastes both of our time. To be clear, our paper will be called:</p>\n\n<div>AF classification from a short single lead ECG recording: The Physionet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017.</div>\n\n<p>... so please do not include the phrases Physionet, Computing in Cardiology, or Challenge 2017 in your title. Please make your title specific to your technique. E.g.: &quot;AF detection using cepstral coefficients, higher order moments and an SVM&quot; would be fine .... but &quot;deep learning for AF detection&quot; is too general and will make your title indistinguishable from half the entries. Think about what makes your approach different.</p>\n\n<h3>Final Entry</h3>\n\n<p>All competitors are required to identify which of their entries they believe is their best performing entry by September 6 at 11am UTC. We will then assess this code on the entire hidden data. Please make your selection by visiting <a href=\"https://physionet.org/pnw/challenge/2017\">https://physionet.org/pnw/challenge/2017</a> and clicking the &quot;Select final entry&quot; button next to your chosen entry. You will be able to change your selection at any time before September 6. If you do not designate a final entry by September 6 at 11:00 AM, we will use your last successfully-submitted entry.</p>\n\n<h3>Papers, Presentations and Posters for CinC</h3>\n\n<h3>Creating your conference paper</h3>\n\n<p>You should post a 99% complete version of your paper at least one week before the conference and mark it openly available for others to read. You obviously can&rsquo;t insert your final score in there until after the conference, and so you will have 3&ndash;4 days after the conference to update your paper. However, you must submit an acceptable and ostensibly complete 4 page paper that will not undergo any revisions after the conference, except to add the final score. Why? Well we don&rsquo;t want you spending time addressing other groups entries. You don&rsquo;t have the time to do it, nor will you have enough detailed information to do so. The time to do that is in the follow-on Physiological Measurement special issue, where we expect you to submit a full paper (as long as you like, as long as it&rsquo;s all pertinent) where you can revisit your algorithm in light of the feedback at the conference, or even improve it by using other competitor&rsquo;s ideas! It would be unfair to do so in the conference article. However, this is exactly how science progresses (after the conference) , and indeed, we hope that this conference facilitates you to swap ideas, question each other, improve, collaborate, compete if you wish (in a kind spirited manner), publish and share.</p>\n\n<p>We strongly advise you to click the box requesting that your article be pushed to the preprint site for the conference&mdash;it will help others understand more clearly what you did, and why you did it (10 minutes or a poster is rarely long enough to explain yourself). Please dedicate your article almost entirely to your methods, including the preprocessing, feature extraction, model pruning, data relabelling, external data sets used, and training cross validation. There is absolutely no need to describe the competition&mdash;we will do that in detail and you can directly reference the challenge website and the article we will publish:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div>Gari Clifford, Chengyu Liu, Benjamin Moody, Li-wei H.

We will post a pre-print of this in mid September (at least a week before the conference and possibly two). It will <strong>not</strong> include the list of winners and the final rankings, although we will add this in the final version immediately after the conference.</p>\n\n<p>Since you do not know who the winner will be, and what your final ranking will be, please do not indicate your position in the rankings until after the competition when the final scores are known. It is misleading to include your rankings either in the unofficial phase or at any time in the official phase. Only the final scores are meaningful, as they will have been assessed on the most accurate version of the (entire) hidden test data.</p>\n\n<p>When creating your 4 page conference article please use this latex example as a template, or download the template from <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu/authors_kit/papers/\">http://cinc.mit.edu/authors_kit/papers/</a> which also includes a Word template (if you feel the need to use that). Further instructions can be found at that URL, and include details such as capitalization of subheadings, etc. Do not play with the margins, font or other parameters. The PDF generated from the source will be auto-checked for format conformity and rejected if the margins are wrong, it is too long or otherwise contravenes the instructions.</p>\n\n<h3>Creating your conference presentation</h3>\n\n<p>If you have been selected for a 10 minute talk, then please create something <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XuyiyjRngEk5juZzX8NNos8VQp2_pcqvhIcfUi79yDI\">like this</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Be concise&mdash;no-one should discuss the aims of the competition or the databases. The challenge organizers will have done that in the first presentation of each session. Instead, focus on what you did&mdash;how you trained your algorithm, what features you selected, which open source algorithms you used, and how you stratified the data. Make sure you present cross fold validation results from the training data (as well as your overall ranking in the official competition). Stratify by patient <strong>and</strong> by database (if you have used external databases). Do not include the scores from the unofficial phase; these are unimportant. Be sure to indicate if your algorithm is open source or not.</p>\n\n<p>Do compare your results to others and be realistic about your performance on the test data. Explain what was novel in your algorithm and what made it work, and also what didn&rsquo;t work too well.</p>\n\n<p>Use pictures on each slide to draw the eye; <strong>please</strong> don&rsquo;t list a series of bullet points and repeat them verbatim. They should be short sentences&mdash;just enough to remind you what you wanted to say. The fewer words the better.</p>\n\n<p>Diagrams are beautiful, so do include them ... but <strong>please</strong> make sure we can read all the captions from the back of the room. Use high contrast <strong>thick</strong> lines; it&rsquo;s usually a long room. Try it out in your biggest auditorium before coming to the conference.</p>\n\n<p>Above all, don&rsquo;t run over; you will look unprofessional and fail to convey your message. Keep it down to 7 slides at most&mdash;you only have 10 minutes and you <strong>will be</strong> cut off after that. (It&rsquo;s unfair to use up other people&rsquo;s time, and you must allow a few minutes for questions). You can add slides afterwards to answer questions, or add a postscript if you want.</p>\n\n<p>So&mdash;make sure you practice your presentation content and timing before you come! Ask your colleagues to listen to you and critique the slides&mdash;if they don&rsquo;t understand you, we probably won&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n<p>More information can be found <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu/authors_kit/presentations/\">here</a>. Please read that carefully.</p>\n\n<h3>Creating your poster presentation</h3>\n\n<p>If you were selected for a poster presentation, don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;you still have to write a paper which is listed with <em>IEEE Explore</em> and Google Scholar, and it counts as much as if you had presented in an oral session. (There&rsquo;s no way to retrospectively find out if your 4 page paper was presented orally or as a poster).</p>\n\n<p>The maximum size was 85 cm (33&quot;) wide by 115 cm (45&quot;) tall for CinC 2016. Note that poster dimensions vary from year to year so don&rsquo;t assume that a size that fit last year will fit this year. You will receive email instructions from the conference organizers explaining this year&rsquo;s restrictions. Please make every attempt to build a visually appealing presentation, which conveys the right points.</p>\n\n<p>More information can be found here: <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu/authors_kit/presentations/\">http://cinc.mit.edu/authors_kit/presentations/</a>. You may want to read these resources from researchers at <a href=\"http://hsp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/ScientificPosters.pdf\">Cornell</a> and <a href=\"https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/e05e05d2-f4ce-4a24-a008-031832bd1509/LearningRes_Open/Course_Book_Ppt_TIUD_Conference_Posters10.pdf\">Oxford</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is a prize for the best poster, so do take it seriously, and make sure you stand by it during your session if you want to be in the running!</p>\n\n<p>Again, more information can be found <a href=\"http://cinc.mit.edu/authors_kit/presentations/\">here</a>. Please read that carefully.</p>\n\n<h3>After the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>As is customary, we hope to run a special issue in <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334\"><em>Physiological Measurement</em></a> with a closing date of 31 January 2018. We will therefore encourage competitors (and non-competitors) to submit updates and further reworks based on the Challenge after the award ceremony at the Computing in Cardiology Conference in Rennes in September.</p>\n\n<h3>Obtaining complimentary MATLAB licenses</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com/\">The MathWorks</a> has kindly decided to sponsor Physionet&rsquo;s 2017 Challenge providing both prize money and licenses. The MathWorks is offering to all teams that wish to use MATLAB, complimentary licenses.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n\n<p>At the end of last year, American scientists Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young received a Nobel Prize in Physiology <em>&ldquo;for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm&quot;</em>&mdash; the mechanism that regulates sleep (<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/nobel-prize-medicine-2017-winners-jeffrey-c-hall-michael-rosbash-and-michael-675266\">Osborn, 2017</a>). The precise reasons why humans sleep (and even how much sleep we need) remains a topic of scientific inquiry. Contemporary theorists indicate that sleep may be responsible for learning and/or the clearing of neural waste products (<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/press_releases/importance_of_sleep_and_health\">Ogilvie and Patel, 2017</a>).</p>\n\n<p>While the precise reasons why we sleep are not perfectly understood, there is consensus on the importance of sleep for our overall health, and well-being. Inadequate sleep is associated with a wide range of negative outcomes including: impaired memory and learning, obesity, irritability, cardiovascular dysfunction, hypotension, diminished immune function (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181883/%23!po%3D3.33333\">Harvard Medical School, 2006</a>), depression (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988690/\">Nutt et al, 2008</a>), and quality of life (<a href=\"https://sleep.org/articles/what-happens-during-sleep/\">Lee, 2009</a>). Further studies even suggest <em>causal</em> links between quality of sleep, and important outcomes including mental health.</p>\n\n<p>It follows that improving the quality of sleep could be used to improve a range of societal health outcomes, more generally. Of course, the treatment of sleep disorders is necessarily preceded by the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Traditionally, such diagnoses are developed in sleep laboratory settings, where polysomnography, audio, and videography of sleeping subject may be carefully inspected by sleep experts to identify potential sleep disorders.</p>\n\n<p>One of the more well-studied sleep disorders is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (or simply, apnea). Apneas are characterized by a complete collapse of the airway, leading to awakening, and consequent disturbances of sleep. While apneas are arguably the best understood of sleep disturbances, they are not the only cause of disturbance. Sleep arousals can also be spontaneous, result from teeth grinding, partial airway obstructions, or even snoring. In this year&#39;s PhysioNet Challenge we will use a variety of physiological signals, collected during polysomnographic sleep studies, to detect these other sources of arousal (non-apnea) during sleep.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenge Data</h3>\n\n<p>Data for this challenge were contributed by the Massachusetts General Hospital&rsquo;s (MGH) Computational Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratory (CCNL), and the Clinical Data Animation Laboratory (CDAC). The dataset includes 1,985 subjects which were monitored at an MGH sleep laboratory for the diagnosis of sleep disorders. The data were partitioned into balanced training (n = 994), and test sets (n = 989).</p>\n\n<p>The sleep stages of the subjects were annotated by clinical staff at the MGH according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual for the scoring of sleep. More specifically, the following six sleep stages were annotated in 30 second contiguous intervals: <em>wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, rapid eye movement (REM), and undefined</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Certified sleep technologists at the MGH also annotated waveforms for the presence of arousals that interrupted the sleep of the subjects. The annotated arousals were classified as either: <em>spontaneous arousals, respiratory effort related arousals (RERA), bruxisms, hypoventilations, hypopneas, apneas (central, obstructive and mixed), vocalizations, snores, periodic leg movements, Cheyne-Stokes breathing or partial airway obstructions.</em></p>\n\n<p>The subjects had a variety of physiological signals recorded as they slept through the night including: electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG), and oxygen saturation (SaO2). Excluding SaO2, all signals were sampled to 200 Hz and were measured in microvolts. For analytic convenience, SaO2 was resampled to 200 Hz, and is measured as a percentage.</p>\n\n<h3>Objective of the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>The goal of the challenge is use information from the available signals to correctly classify target arousal regions. For the purpose of the Challenge, <em>target arousals</em> are defined as regions where either of the following conditions were met:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>From 2 seconds before a RERA arousal begins, up to 10 seconds after it ends or,</li>\n\t<li>From 2 seconds before a non-RERA, non-apnea arousal begins, up to 2 seconds after it ends.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please note that regions falling within 10 seconds before or after a subject wakes up, has an apnea arousal, or a hypopnea arousal <strong>will not be scored</strong> for the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>We have pre-computed the target arousals for you. They are contained in a sample-wise vector (described below in &ldquo;Accessing the Data&rdquo;), marked by &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Regions that will not be scored are marked by a &ldquo;-1&rdquo;, and regions that will be penalized if marked by your algorithm are marked by &ldquo;0&rdquo;. <em>You do not need to recompute these scores.</em></p>\n\n<h3>Accessing the Data</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2018/training.torrent\">Click here</a> to download the complete training database (135 GB) using BitTorrent.</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://physionet.org/challenge/2018/test.torrent\">Click here</a> to download the complete test database (133 GB) using BitTorrent.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t have a BitTorrent client, we recommend <a href=\"https://transmissionbt.com/\">Transmission</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2018/\">Challenge data repository</a> contains two directories (<code>training</code> and <code>test</code>) which are each approximately 135 GB in size.

You will be notified if your abstract has been accepted by email from CinC during the first week in June.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Wildcard submissions</strong>: For teams who did not submit an abstract in time, or whose abstracts were not accepted, the team who submits the highest-scoring entry before <strong>15 July 2018</strong> will have another chance to compete, if they submit a high-quality abstract and present their work at the CinC conference. We will contact the winners in July with more information.</li>\n\t<li>Submit a full (4-page) paper on your work on the Challenge to CinC no later than the deadline of conference paper submission.</li>\n\t<li>Attend CinC 2018 (<strong>23-26 September 2018</strong>) in Maastricht and present your work there.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please do not submit analysis of this year&rsquo;s Challenge data to other Conferences or Journals until after CinC 2018 has taken place, so the competitors are able to discuss the results in a single forum. We expect a special issue from the journal <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334\"><em>Physiological Measurement</em></a> to follow the conference and encourage all entrants (and those who missed the opportunity to compete or attend CinC 2018) to submit extended analysis and articles to that issue, taking into account the publications and discussions at CinC 2018.</p>\n\n<h3>Attending the Conference</h3>\n\n<p>If your abstract is accepted, you must <a href=\"https://www.softconf.com/i/cinc2018/\">log in to the conference site</a> and agree that you will attend. Then, you must submit a full article describing your results and mark it as a preprint (for others to read) by September 15th. (Don&#39;t forget that the competition deadline is noon GMT on the 1st September - this deadline will *not* be extended.)</p>\n\n<p>After agreeing to attend, you must register for the conference, pay the conference fee (prices go up after July ends), and secure a visa if you need one. See <a href=\"http://www.cinc.org/information-for-computing-in-cardiology-authors/\">the Computing in Cardiology site</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<p>If you need a visa, we <em>strongly</em> suggest you register this week and begin the process. Visas can take months to issue and attendance is mandatory - you cannot receive a prize if you do not attend because defending your work is part of the Challenge. The conference (not PhysioNet) will supply you with a letter for your visa. Please <a href=\"http://www.cinc2018.org/visa/\">see the CinC 2018 site</a> for details on how to obtain that letter and who to contact. If you have any questions about this process, or are concerned about paying the conference fee before securing a visa, please contact the conference organizers, not PhysioNet.</p>\n\n<p>If your abstract is rejected, then you have one more chance! This year we are introducing a &#39;wildcard&#39; submission. On July the 15th, the top scoring entry that has <em>not</em> so far been accepted to CinC will be offered the opportunity to submit another (or a new) abstract to the conference system (containing full results). If the team can submit a quality abstract (with performance results) and register for the conference then it&#39;s members will be eligible for a prize (assuming they also attend the conference and present a poster). Don&#39;t forget, your abstract was probably rejected because it didn&#39;t contain any useful results (even on training data) and/or did not describe your methods well. So please pay attention to the abstract when submitting - it won&#39;t be automatic. We strongly believe that if you are unable to explain what you did and why, then the code is of very limited value.</p>\n\n<p>We hope this is a suitable encouragement for teams that are either late to the Challenge or failed to secure a place at the conference to continue with their efforts in the competition. It would be a shame not to see potentially great works at the conference.</p>\n\n<p>Look out for future announcements via <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/group/physionet-challenges\">the community discussion forum</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>After the Challenge</h3>\n\n<p>As is customary, we hope to run a special issue in <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334\"><em>Physiological Measurement</em></a> with a closing date of 31 January 2019. We will therefore encourage competitors (and non-competitors) to submit updates and further reworks based on the Challenge after the award ceremony at the Computing in Cardiology Conference in Maastricht in September.</p>\n\n<h3>Obtaining complimentary MATLAB licenses</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com/\">The MathWorks</a> has kindly decided to sponsor Physionet&rsquo;s 2018 Challenge providing licenses.

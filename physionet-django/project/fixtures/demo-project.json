    "abstract": "<p>The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database contains 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings, obtained from 47 subjects studied by the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory between 1975 and 1979. Twenty-three recordings were chosen at random from a set of 4000 24-hour ambulatory ECG recordings collected from a mixed population of inpatients (about 60%) and outpatients (about 40%) at Boston&#39;s Beth Israel Hospital; the remaining 25 recordings were selected from the same set to include less common but clinically significant arrhythmias that would not be well-represented in a small random sample.</p>",
    "background": "<p>Since 1975, our laboratories at Boston&#39;s Beth Israel Hospital (now the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) and at MIT have supported our own research into arrhythmia analysis and related subjects. One of the first major products of that effort was the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which we completed and began distributing in 1980. The database was the first generally available set of standard test material for evaluation of arrhythmia detectors, and has been used for that purpose as well as for basic research into cardiac dynamics at more than 500 sites worldwide. Originally, we distributed the database on 9-track half-inch digital tape at 800 and 1600 bpi, and on quarter-inch IRIG-format FM analog tape. In August, 1989, we produced a CD-ROM version of the database.</p>",
    "methods": "<p>The recordings were digitized at 360 samples per second per channel with 11-bit resolution over a 10 mV range. Two or more cardiologists independently annotated each record; disagreements were resolved to obtain the computer-readable reference annotations for each beat (approximately 110,000 annotations in all) included with the database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The charts for each recording were given to two cardiologists, who worked independently, adding additional beat labels and deleting false detections as necessary, and changing the labels for abnormal beats. The cardiologists also added rhythm and signal quality labels. At this point the two sets of annotations were compared automatically and another chart recording was printed, showing the cardiologists&rsquo; annotations in the margin, with all discrepancies highlighted. Each discrepancy was examined and resolved by consensus.</p>",
    "content_description": "<p>This directory contains the entire MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. About half (25 of 48 complete records, and reference annotation files for all 48 records) of this database has been freely available here since PhysioNet&#39;s inception in September 1999. The 23 remaining signal files, which had been available only on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database CD-ROM, were posted here in February 2005.</p>",

    "title": "MIMIC-III Clinical Database",
    "abstract": "<p>MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign measurements made at the bedside (~1 data point per hour), laboratory test results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, and mortality (both in and out of hospital).</p>",
    "background": "<p>In recent years there has been a concerted move towards the adoption of digital health record systems in hospitals. In the US, for example, the number of non-federal acute care hospitals with basic digital systems increased from 9.4 to 75.5% over the 7 year period between 2008 and 2014 [1].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite this advance, interoperability of digital systems remains an open issue, leading to challenges in data integration. As a result, the potential that hospital data offers in terms of understanding and improving care is yet to be fully realized. In parallel, the scientific research community is increasingly coming under criticism for the lack of reproducibility of studies [2].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we report the release of the MIMIC-III database [3], an update to the widely-used MIMIC-II database. MIMIC-III integrates deidentified, comprehensive clinical data of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, and makes it widely accessible to researchers internationally under a data use agreement. The open nature of the data allows clinical studies to be reproduced and improved in ways that would not otherwise be possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on our experience with the previous major release of MIMIC (MIMIC-II, released in 2010) we anticipate MIMIC-III to be widely used internationally in areas such as academic and industrial research, quality improvement initiatives, and higher education coursework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To recognize the increasingly broad usage of MIMIC, we have renamed the full title of the database from &lsquo;Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care&rsquo; to &lsquo;Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care&rsquo;. The MIMIC-III critical care database is unique and notable for the following reasons:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>it is the only freely accessible critical care database of its kind</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>the dataset spans more than a decade, with detailed information about individual patient care</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>analysis is unrestricted once a data use agreement is accepted, enabling clinical research and education around the world.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>",
    "methods": "<p>The Laboratory for Computational Physiology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology is an interdisciplinary team of data scientists and practicing physicians. MIMIC-III is the third iteration of the MIMIC critical care database, enabling us to draw upon prior experience with regard to data management and integration</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Database development</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MIMIC-III database was populated with data that had been acquired during routine hospital care, so there was no associated burden on caregivers and no interference with their workflow. Data was downloaded from several sources, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>archives from critical care information systems.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>hospital electronic health record databases.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Social Security Administration Death Master File.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Two different critical care information systems were in place over the data collection period: Philips CareVue Clinical Information System (models M2331A and M1215A; Philips Health-care, Andover, MA) and iMDsoft MetaVision ICU (iMDsoft, Needham, MA). These systems were the source of clinical data such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>time-stamped nurse-verified physiological measurements (for example, hourly documentation of heart rate, arterial blood pressure, or respiratory rate);</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>documented progress notes by care providers;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>continuous intravenous drip medications and fluid balances.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With exception to data relating to fluid intake, which differed significantly in structure between the CareVue and MetaVision systems, data was merged when building the database tables. Data which could not be merged is given a suffix to denote the data source. For example, inputs for patients monitored with the CareVue system are stored in INPUTEVENTS_CV, whereas inputs for patients monitored with the Metavision system are stored in INPUTEVENTS_MV. Additional information was collected from hospital and laboratory health record systems, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>patient demographics and in-hospital mortality.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>laboratory test results (for example, hematology, chemistry, and microbiology results).</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>discharge summaries and reports of electrocardiogram and imaging studies.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>billing-related information such as International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition (ICD-9) codes, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Out-of-hospital mortality dates were obtained using the Social Security Administration Death Master File. A more detailed description of the data is shown in Table 1. Physiological waveforms obtained from bedside monitors (such as electrocardiograms, blood pressure waveforms, photoplethysmograms, impedance pneumograms) were obtained for a subset of patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several projects are ongoing to map concepts within the MIMIC database to standardized dictionaries. For example, researchers at the National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health have mapped laboratory tests and medications in MIMIC-II to LOINC and RxNorm, respectively<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635#ref4\" id=\"ref-link-section-4\" title=\" Abhyankar, S., Demner-Fushman, D. &amp; McDonald, C. J. Standardizing clinical laboratory data for secondary use. J Biomed Inform 45, 642\u2013650 (2012). \">4</a>. Efforts are also underway to transform MIMIC to common data models, such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, to support the application of standardized tools and methods<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635#ref5\" id=\"ref-link-section-5\" title=\" Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Website http://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/(Accessed: March 2016). \">5</a>. These developments are progressively incorporated into the MIMIC database where possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA). Requirement for individual patient consent was waived because the project did not impact clinical care and all protected health information was deidentified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Deidentification</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before data was incorporated into the MIMIC-III database, it was first deidentified in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards using structured data cleansing and date shifting. The deidentification process for structured data required the removal of all eighteen of the identifying data elements listed in HIPAA, including fields such as patient name, telephone number, address, and dates. In particular, dates were shifted into the future by a random offset for each individual patient in a consistent manner to preserve intervals, resulting in stays which occur sometime between the years 2100 and 2200. Time of day, day of the week, and approximate seasonality were conserved during date shifting. Dates of birth for patients aged over 89 were shifted to obscure their true age and comply with HIPAA regulations: these patients appear in the database with ages of over 300 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protected health information was removed from free text fields, such as diagnostic reports and physician notes, using a rigorously evaluated deidentification system based on extensive dictionary look-ups and pattern-matching with regular expressions. The components of this deidentification system are continually expanded as new data is acquired.</p>",
    "content_description": "<p><strong>Patient characteristics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MIMIC-III contains data associated with 53,423 distinct hospital admissions for adult patients (aged 16 years or above) admitted to critical care units between 2001 and 2012. In addition, it contains data for 7870 neonates admitted between 2001 and 2008. The data covers 38,597 distinct adult patients and 49,785 hospital admissions. The median age of adult patients is 65.8 years (Q1&ndash;Q3: 52.8&ndash;77.8), 55.9% patients are male, and in-hospital mortality is 11.5%. The median length of an ICU stay is 2.1 days (Q1&ndash;Q3: 1.2&ndash;4.6) and the median length of a hospital stay is 6.9 days (Q1-Q3: 4.1&ndash;11.9). A mean of 4579 charted observations (&rsquo;chartevents&rsquo;) and 380 laboratory measurements (&rsquo;labevents&rsquo;) are available for each hospital admission.

    "usage_notes": "<p>Data from each patient is collected into a common warehouse only if certain &ldquo;interfaces&rdquo; are available.

Licensors may therefore wish\r\nto use this license together with another license for the contents.\r\n\r\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\r\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\r\ntrademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\r\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may\r\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\r\nactivities not covered by this License.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe Licensor (as defined below) \r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nYou (as defined below) \r\n\r\nagree as follows: \r\n\r\n### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words\r\n\r\n\"Collective Database\" - Means this Database in unmodified form as part\r\nof a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are\r\nassembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective\r\nDatabase will not be considered a Derivative Database.\r\n\r\n\"Convey\" - As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,\r\nor the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables\r\na Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative\r\nDatabase.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a\r\ncomputer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no\r\ntransfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.\r\n\r\n\"Contents\" - The contents of this Database, which includes the\r\ninformation, independent works, or other material collected into the\r\nDatabase. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual\r\ndata or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.\r\n\r\n\"Database\" - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a\r\nsystematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic\r\nor other means offered under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n\"Database Directive\" - Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection\r\nof databases, as amended or succeeded.\r\n\r\n\"Database Right\" - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (\"sui\r\ngeneris\") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed\r\nby member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of\r\nthe whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar\r\nrights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4. \r\n\r\n\"Derivative Database\" - Means a database based upon the Database, and\r\nincludes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any\r\nother alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the\r\nContents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or\r\nRe-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new\r\nDatabase.\r\n\r\n\"Extraction\" - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a\r\nSubstantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in\r\nany form.\r\n\r\n\"License\" - Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights\r\nsuch as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.\r\n\r\n\"Licensor\" - Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms\r\nof this License. \r\n\r\n\"Person\" - Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons\r\ncorporate or incorporate.\r\n\r\n\"Produced Work\" - a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text,\r\nor sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the\r\nContents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative\r\nDatabase, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.  \r\n\r\n\"Publicly\" - means to Persons other than You or under Your control by\r\neither more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their\r\nactivities (such as contracting with an independent consultant). \r\n\r\n\"Re-utilisation\" - means any form of making available to the public all\r\nor a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by\r\nrenting, by online or other forms of transmission.\r\n\r\n\"Substantial\" - Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a\r\ncombination of both.

Legal effect of this document. This License is:\r\n\r\n  a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;\r\n\r\n  b. A license of the Database Right; and\r\n\r\n  c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.\r\n\r\n2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the\r\nDatabase, including:\r\n\r\n  a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.\r\n  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the\r\n  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents\r\n  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright\r\n  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database\r\n  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation\r\n  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table\r\n  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of\r\n  Contents stored in the Database;\r\n\r\n  b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and\r\n  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.\r\n  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the\r\n  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed\r\n  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would\r\n  not infringe any applicable copyright; and\r\n\r\n  c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for\r\n  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of\r\n  use on this access as outlined in this License. \r\n\r\n2.3 Rights not covered. \r\n\r\n  a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making\r\n  or operation of the Database; \r\n\r\n  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the\r\n  Database; and\r\n\r\n  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the\r\n  Database. \r\n\r\n2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of\r\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,\r\nincluding copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality\r\nrights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database\r\nRights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.\r\nFor example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this\r\nLicense would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could\r\nhave their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of\r\nthe rights over the images.  \r\n\r\n### 3.0 Rights granted\r\n\r\n3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor\r\ngrants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but\r\nonly under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of\r\nany applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly\r\ninclude commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To\r\nthe extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be\r\nexercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the\r\nfuture. \r\n\r\nThe rights granted cover, for example:\r\n\r\n  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of\r\n  the Contents;\r\n\r\n  b. Creation of Derivative Databases;\r\n\r\n  c. Creation of Collective Databases;\r\n\r\n  d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and\r\n  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative\r\n  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and\r\n\r\n  e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or\r\n  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in\r\n  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective\r\n  Databases.\r\n\r\n3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\n  a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\r\n  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\r\n  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves\r\n  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\r\n  of the rights granted under this License;\r\n\r\n  b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\r\n  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\r\n  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\r\n  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of\r\n  the rights granted under this License; and,\r\n\r\n  c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\r\n  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is\r\n  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\r\n  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\r\n  granted under this License.\r\n\r\n3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop\r\ndistributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that\r\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice\r\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section\r\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.\r\n\r\n### 4.0 Conditions of Use\r\n\r\n4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to\r\nYour complying with the following conditions of use. These are important\r\nconditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be\r\nin material breach of its terms.\r\n\r\n4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative\r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You\r\nmust: \r\n\r\n  a. Do so only under the terms of this License;\r\n\r\n  b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\r\n  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the\r\n  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; \r\n\r\n  c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices\r\n  that refer to this License; and\r\n\r\n  d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular\r\n  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a\r\n  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to\r\n  look for it.\r\n\r\n4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced\r\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you\r\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with\r\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,\r\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced\r\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative\r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it\r\nis available under this License.\r\n\r\n  a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under\r\n  Section 4.3:\r\n\r\n        Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available\r\n        under the ODC Attribution License.\r\n\r\nDATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a\r\nhyperlink to the location of the Database. \"ODC Attribution License\"\r\nshould contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If\r\nhyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the\r\nrequired URI's with the above notice.\r\n\r\n4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time\r\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the\r\nContents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the\r\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same\r\nterms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for\r\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may\r\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are\r\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made\r\nby You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any\r\nfurther restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed\r\nunder this License.\r\n\r\n### 5.0 Moral rights\r\n\r\n5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights\r\nto be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment\r\nthat would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or\r\nany other derogatory treatment:\r\n\r\n  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives\r\n  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest\r\n  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section\r\n  10.4; \r\n\r\n  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant\r\n  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral\r\n  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the\r\n  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under\r\n  Section 10.4; and\r\n\r\n  c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert\r\n  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their\r\n  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.\r\n\r\nPlease note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral\r\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some\r\njurisdictions.\r\n\r\n### 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected \r\n\r\n6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may\r\nindependently have under any applicable law to make any use of this\r\nDatabase, including without limitation:\r\n\r\n  a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents\r\n  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for\r\n  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and\r\n  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative\r\n  or judicial procedure. \r\n\r\n  b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation\r\n  or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. \r\n\r\n6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract\r\nand Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated\r\nquantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including\r\ncreating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the\r\nContents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or\r\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount\r\nto the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the\r\nContents.\r\n\r\n### 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\n7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor \"as is\" and without any\r\nwarranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,\r\ncustom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically\r\ndisclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,\r\nnon-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of\r\nerrors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.\r\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so\r\nthis exclusion may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n### 8.0 Limitation of liability\r\n\r\n8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,\r\nthe Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability\r\nfor loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use\r\nunder this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused\r\nby any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of\r\nliability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,\r\nconsequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,\r\ndata, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies\r\neven if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and\r\ndirect financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on\r\nthe part of the Licensor.\r\n\r\n### 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License\r\n\r\n9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License\r\nautomatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without\r\nnotice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the\r\nDatabase, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative\r\nDatabases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You\r\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated provided\r\ntheir use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted\r\nunder Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will\r\nsurvive any termination of this License.\r\n\r\n9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor\r\nwill not terminate Your rights under it. \r\n\r\n9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You\r\nfor the duration of applicable rights in the Database. \r\n\r\n9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and\r\nconditions of this License, then your full rights under this License\r\nwill be reinstated:\r\n\r\n  a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th\r\n  day after cessation of breach; \r\n\r\n  b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless\r\n  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or\r\n\r\n  c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the\r\n  violation, this is the first time You have received notice of\r\n  violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the\r\n  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release\r\nthe Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or\r\nmaking available the Database. Releasing the Database under different\r\nlicense terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not\r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\r\nstated above.\r\n\r\n### 10.0 General\r\n\r\n10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or\r\nunenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\nthe remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each\r\nremaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the\r\nfullest extent permitted by law. \r\n\r\n10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with\r\nrespect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any\r\nearlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\r\nthe Database. \r\n\r\n10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be\r\nentitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any\r\nbreach by the Licensor. \r\n\r\n10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by\r\nthe laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are\r\nsought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under\r\napplicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant\r\njurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,\r\nthese additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the\r\nterms of this License.",

Legal effect of this document. This License is:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. A license of the Database Right; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the<br />\r\nDatabase, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.<br />\r\nThe copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the<br />\r\nDatabase, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents<br />\r\nindependent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright<br />\r\nlaw varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database<br />\r\nmodel or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation<br />\r\nof the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table<br />\r\nindexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of<br />\r\nContents stored in the Database;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and<br />\r\nRe-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.<br />\r\nDatabase Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the<br />\r\nDatabase. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed<br />\r\nfrom the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would<br />\r\nnot infringe any applicable copyright; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for<br />\r\naccess to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of<br />\r\nuse on this access as outlined in this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.3 Rights not covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making<br />\r\nor operation of the Database;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the<br />\r\nDatabase; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the<br />\r\nDatabase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of<br />\r\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,<br />\r\nincluding copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality<br />\r\nrights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database<br />\r\nRights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.<br />\r\nFor example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this<br />\r\nLicense would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could<br />\r\nhave their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of<br />\r\nthe rights over the images.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.0 Rights granted</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor<br />\r\ngrants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but<br />\r\nonly under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of<br />\r\nany applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly<br />\r\ninclude commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To<br />\r\nthe extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be<br />\r\nexercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the<br />\r\nfuture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rights granted cover, for example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of<br />\r\nthe Contents;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Creation of Derivative Databases;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c.

Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or<br />\r\nperformance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in<br />\r\npart, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective<br />\r\nDatabases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br />\r\nwhich the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br />\r\ncompulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves<br />\r\nthe exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You<br />\r\nof the rights granted under this License;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br />\r\nwhich the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br />\r\ncompulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the<br />\r\nexclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of<br />\r\nthe rights granted under this License; and,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect<br />\r\nroyalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is<br />\r\na member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing<br />\r\nschemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights<br />\r\ngranted under this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop<br />\r\ndistributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that<br />\r\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice<br />\r\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section<br />\r\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4.0 Conditions of Use</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to<br />\r\nYour complying with the following conditions of use. These are important<br />\r\nconditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be<br />\r\nin material breach of its terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative<br />\r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You<br />\r\nmust:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Do so only under the terms of this License;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)<br />\r\nwith the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the<br />\r\nDatabase or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices<br />\r\nthat refer to this License; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular<br />\r\nfile due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a<br />\r\nlocation (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to<br />\r\nlook for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced<br />\r\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you<br />\r\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with<br />\r\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,<br />\r\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced<br />\r\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative<br />\r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it<br />\r\nis available under this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under<br />\r\nSection 4.3:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available under the ODC Attribution License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a<br />\r\nhyperlink to the location of the Database. &ldquo;ODC Attribution License&rdquo;<br />\r\nshould contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If<br />\r\nhyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the<br />\r\nrequired URI&rsquo;s with the above notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time<br />\r\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the<br />\r\nContents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the<br />\r\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same<br />\r\nterms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for<br />\r\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may<br />\r\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are<br />\r\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made<br />\r\nby You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any<br />\r\nfurther restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed<br />\r\nunder this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.0 Moral rights</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights<br />\r\nto be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment<br />\r\nthat would otherwise prejudice the author&rsquo;s honour and reputation, or<br />\r\nany other derogatory treatment:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives<br />\r\nall moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest<br />\r\nextent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section<br />\r\n10.4;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant<br />\r\njurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral<br />\r\nrights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the<br />\r\nfullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under<br />\r\nSection 10.4; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert<br />\r\nmoral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their<br />\r\nmoral rights over certain aspects of the Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral<br />\r\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some<br />\r\njurisdictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may<br />\r\nindependently have under any applicable law to make any use of this<br />\r\nDatabase, including without limitation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents<br />\r\nfrom non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for<br />\r\npurposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and<br />\r\nExtraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative<br />\r\nor judicial procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation<br />\r\nor exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract<br />\r\nand Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated<br />\r\nquantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including<br />\r\ncreating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the<br />\r\nContents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or<br />\r\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount<br />\r\nto the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the<br />\r\nContents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and without any<br />\r\nwarranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,<br />\r\ncustom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically<br />\r\ndisclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,<br />\r\nnon-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of<br />\r\nerrors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.<br />\r\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so<br />\r\nthis exclusion may not apply to You.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8.0 Limitation of liability</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,<br />\r\nthe Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability<br />\r\nfor loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use<br />\r\nunder this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused<br />\r\nby any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of<br />\r\nliability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,<br />\r\nconsequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,<br />\r\ndata, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies<br />\r\neven if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such<br />\r\ndamages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and<br />\r\ndirect financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on<br />\r\nthe part of the Licensor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License<br />\r\nautomatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without<br />\r\nnotice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the<br />\r\nDatabase, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative<br />\r\nDatabases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You<br />\r\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated provided<br />\r\ntheir use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted<br />\r\nunder Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will<br />\r\nsurvive any termination of this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor<br />\r\nwill not terminate Your rights under it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You<br />\r\nfor the duration of applicable rights in the Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and<br />\r\nconditions of this License, then your full rights under this License<br />\r\nwill be reinstated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th<br />\r\nday after cessation of breach;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless<br />\r\notherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the<br />\r\nviolation, this is the first time You have received notice of<br />\r\nviolation of this License from the Licensor, and You cure the<br />\r\nviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release<br />\r\nthe Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or<br />\r\nmaking available the Database. Releasing the Database under different<br />\r\nlicense terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not<br />\r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br />\r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br />\r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br />\r\nstated above.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10.0 General</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or<br />\r\nunenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of<br />\r\nthe remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each<br />\r\nremaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the<br />\r\nfullest extent permitted by law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with<br />\r\nrespect to the rights granted here over the Database.

Many databases are covered by\r\ncopyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some\r\njurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that\r\ncover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,\r\nthe ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to\r\nact in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.\r\n\r\nDatabases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,\r\naudiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),\r\nand so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the\r\ncontents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL\r\ntogether with another license for the contents, if the contents have a\r\nsingle set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the\r\ncontents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should\r\ndescribe what rights govern what contents together in the individual\r\nrecord or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply. \r\n\r\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\r\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\r\ntrade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\r\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may\r\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\r\nactivities not covered by this License.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe Licensor (as defined below) \r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nYou (as defined below) \r\n\r\nagree as follows: \r\n\r\n### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words\r\n\r\n\"Collective Database\" - Means this Database in unmodified form as part\r\nof a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are\r\nassembled into a collective whole.

See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright\r\n  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database\r\n  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation\r\n  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table\r\n  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of\r\n  Contents stored in the Database;\r\n\r\n  b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and\r\n  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.\r\n  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the\r\n  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed\r\n  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would\r\n  not infringe any applicable copyright; and\r\n\r\n  c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for\r\n  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of\r\n  use on this access as outlined in this License. \r\n\r\n2.3 Rights not covered. \r\n\r\n  a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making\r\n  or operation of the Database; \r\n\r\n  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the\r\n  Database; and\r\n\r\n  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the\r\n  Database. \r\n\r\n2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of\r\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,\r\nincluding copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality\r\nrights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database\r\nRights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.\r\nFor example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this\r\nLicense would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could\r\nhave their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of\r\nthe rights over the images.  \r\n\r\n### 3.0 Rights granted\r\n\r\n3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor\r\ngrants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but\r\nonly under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of\r\nany applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly\r\ninclude commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To\r\nthe extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be\r\nexercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the\r\nfuture. \r\n\r\nThe rights granted cover, for example:\r\n\r\n  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of\r\n  the Contents;\r\n\r\n  b. Creation of Derivative Databases;\r\n\r\n  c. Creation of Collective Databases;\r\n\r\n  d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and\r\n  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative\r\n  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and\r\n\r\n  e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or\r\n  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in\r\n  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective\r\n  Databases.\r\n\r\n3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\n  a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\r\n  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\r\n  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves\r\n  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\r\n  of the rights granted under this License;\r\n\r\n  b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\r\n  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\r\n  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\r\n  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of\r\n  the rights granted under this License; and,\r\n\r\n  c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\r\n  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is\r\n  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\r\n  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\r\n  granted under this License.\r\n\r\n3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop\r\ndistributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that\r\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice\r\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section\r\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.\r\n\r\n### 4.0 Conditions of Use\r\n\r\n4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to\r\nYour complying with the following conditions of use. These are important\r\nconditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be\r\nin material breach of its terms.\r\n\r\n4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative\r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You\r\nmust: \r\n\r\n  a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license\r\n  permitted under Section 4.4;\r\n\r\n  b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license\r\n  permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\r\n  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the\r\n  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and\r\n\r\n  c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices\r\n  that refer to this License.\r\n\r\n  d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular\r\n  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a\r\n  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to\r\n  look for it.\r\n\r\n4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced\r\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you\r\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with\r\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,\r\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced\r\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative\r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it\r\nis available under this License.\r\n\r\n  a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under\r\n  Section 4.3:\r\n\r\n        Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available\r\n        here under the Open Database License (ODbL).\r\n\r\nDATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a\r\nhyperlink to the URI of the Database. \"Open Database License\" should\r\ncontain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If\r\nhyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the\r\nrequired URI's with the above notice.\r\n \r\n4.4 Share alike. \r\n\r\n  a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under\r\n  the terms of: \r\n\r\n    i. This License;\r\n\r\n    ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this\r\n      License; or\r\n\r\n    iii. A compatible license. \r\n\r\n  If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses\r\n  mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license. \r\n\r\n  b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the\r\n  whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a\r\n  Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4. \r\n\r\n  c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works.  A Derivative Database is\r\n  Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work\r\n  created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.\r\n\r\n  d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,\r\n  You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a\r\n  that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License. \r\n\r\n  e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine\r\n  compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the\r\n  authorised proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible\r\n  license grants You permission to use the compatible license.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.5 Limits of Share Alike.  The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply\r\nin the following:\r\n\r\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license\r\n  Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this\r\n  Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License\r\n  still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of\r\n  the Collective Database; \r\n\r\n  b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as\r\n  part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not\r\n  create a Derivative Database for purposes of  Section 4.4; and\r\n\r\n  c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is\r\n  not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements\r\n  of Section 4.4.\r\n\r\n4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative\r\nDatabase or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also\r\noffer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy\r\nin a machine readable form of:\r\n\r\n  a. The entire Derivative Database; or\r\n\r\n  b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or\r\n  the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an\r\n  algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the\r\n  differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.\r\n\r\nThe Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be\r\navailable at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical\r\ndistributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.\r\n\r\n4.7 Technological measures and additional terms\r\n\r\n  a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to\r\n  Section 4.7 b.)  any terms or any technological measures on the\r\n  Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of\r\n  the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any\r\n  rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting\r\n  the ability of any person to exercise those rights.\r\n\r\n  b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological\r\n  measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a\r\n  Substantial part of the Contents (a \"Restricted Database\") in\r\n  contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the\r\n  Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the\r\n  Restricted Database:\r\n\r\n    i. That is available without additional fee;\r\n\r\n    ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict\r\n    the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have\r\n    the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to\r\n    exercise those rights (an \"Unrestricted Database\"); and\r\n\r\n    iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the\r\n    recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.\r\n\r\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a\r\n  Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a\r\n  password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You\r\n  do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights\r\n  granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the\r\n  ability of any person to exercise those rights. \r\n\r\n4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time\r\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the\r\nContents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the\r\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same\r\nterms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for\r\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may\r\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are\r\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made\r\nby You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any\r\nfurther restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed\r\nunder this License.\r\n\r\n### 5.0 Moral rights\r\n\r\n5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights\r\nto be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment\r\nthat would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or\r\nany other derogatory treatment:\r\n\r\n  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives\r\n  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest\r\n  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section\r\n  10.4; \r\n\r\n  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant\r\n  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral\r\n  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the\r\n  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under\r\n  Section 10.4; and\r\n\r\n  c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert\r\n  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their\r\n  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.\r\n\r\nPlease note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral\r\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some\r\njurisdictions.\r\n\r\n### 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected \r\n\r\n6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may\r\nindependently have under any applicable law to make any use of this\r\nDatabase, including without limitation:\r\n\r\n  a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents\r\n  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for\r\n  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and\r\n  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative\r\n  or judicial procedure. \r\n\r\n  b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation\r\n  or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. \r\n\r\n6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract\r\nand Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated\r\nquantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including\r\ncreating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the\r\nContents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or\r\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount\r\nto the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the\r\nContents.\r\n\r\n### 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer\r\n\r\n7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor \"as is\" and without any\r\nwarranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,\r\ncustom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically\r\ndisclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,\r\nnon-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of\r\nerrors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.\r\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so\r\nthis exclusion may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n### 8.0 Limitation of liability\r\n\r\n8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,\r\nthe Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability\r\nfor loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use\r\nunder this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused\r\nby any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of\r\nliability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,\r\nconsequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,\r\ndata, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies\r\neven if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and\r\ndirect financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on\r\nthe part of the Licensor.\r\n\r\n### 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License\r\n\r\n9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License\r\nautomatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without\r\nnotice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the\r\nDatabase, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative\r\nDatabases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You\r\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated provided\r\ntheir use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted\r\nunder Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will\r\nsurvive any termination of this License.\r\n\r\n9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor\r\nwill not terminate Your rights under it. \r\n\r\n9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You\r\nfor the duration of applicable rights in the Database. \r\n\r\n9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and\r\nconditions of this License, then your full rights under this License\r\nwill be reinstated:\r\n\r\n  a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th\r\n  day after cessation of breach; \r\n\r\n  b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless\r\n  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or\r\n\r\n  c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the\r\n  violation, this is the first time You have received notice of\r\n  violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the\r\n  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\nPersons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to\r\nbe a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.\r\n\r\n9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release\r\nthe Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or\r\nmaking available the Database. Releasing the Database under different\r\nlicense terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not\r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\r\nstated above.\r\n\r\n### 10.0 General\r\n\r\n10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or\r\nunenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\nthe remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each\r\nremaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the\r\nfullest extent permitted by law. \r\n\r\n10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with\r\nrespect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any\r\nearlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\r\nthe Database. \r\n\r\n10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be\r\nentitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any\r\nbreach by the Licensor. \r\n\r\n10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by\r\nthe laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are\r\nsought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under\r\napplicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant\r\njurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,\r\nthese additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the\r\nterms of this License.",

Many databases are covered by<br />\r\ncopyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some<br />\r\njurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that<br />\r\ncover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,<br />\r\nthe ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to<br />\r\nact in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,<br />\r\naudiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),<br />\r\nand so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the<br />\r\ncontents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL<br />\r\ntogether with another license for the contents, if the contents have a<br />\r\nsingle set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the<br />\r\ncontents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should<br />\r\ndescribe what rights govern what contents together in the individual<br />\r\nrecord or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be<br />\r\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,<br />\r\ntrade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights<br />\r\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may<br />\r\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing<br />\r\nactivities not covered by this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Licensor (as defined below)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You (as defined below)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>agree as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Collective Database&rdquo; &ndash; Means this Database in unmodified form as part<br />\r\nof a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are<br />\r\nassembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective<br />\r\nDatabase will not be considered a Derivative Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Convey&rdquo; &ndash; As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,<br />\r\nor the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables<br />\r\na Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative<br />\r\nDatabase. Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a<br />\r\ncomputer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no<br />\r\ntransfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.<br />\r\n&ldquo;Contents&rdquo; &ndash; The contents of this Database, which includes the<br />\r\ninformation, independent works, or other material collected into the<br />\r\nDatabase. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual<br />\r\ndata or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Database&rdquo; &ndash; A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a<br />\r\nsystematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic<br />\r\nor other means offered under the terms of this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Database Directive&rdquo; &ndash; Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European<br />\r\nParliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection<br />\r\nof databases, as amended or succeeded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Database Right&rdquo; &ndash; Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (&ldquo;sui<br />\r\ngeneris&rdquo;) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed<br />\r\nby member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of<br />\r\nthe whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar<br />\r\nrights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Derivative Database&rdquo; &ndash; Means a database based upon the Database, and<br />\r\nincludes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any<br />\r\nother alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the<br />\r\nContents.

Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.<br />\r\nThe copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the<br />\r\nDatabase, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents<br />\r\nindependent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright<br />\r\nlaw varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database<br />\r\nmodel or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation<br />\r\nof the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table<br />\r\nindexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of<br />\r\nContents stored in the Database;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and<br />\r\nRe-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.<br />\r\nDatabase Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed<br />\r\nfrom the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would<br />\r\nnot infringe any applicable copyright; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for<br />\r\naccess to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of<br />\r\nuse on this access as outlined in this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.3 Rights not covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making<br />\r\nor operation of the Database;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the<br />\r\nDatabase; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of<br />\r\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,<br />\r\nincluding copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality<br />\r\nrights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database<br />\r\nRights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.<br />\r\nFor example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this<br />\r\nLicense would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could<br />\r\nhave their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of<br />\r\nthe rights over the images.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.0 Rights granted</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor<br />\r\ngrants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but<br />\r\nonly under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of<br />\r\nany applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly<br />\r\ninclude commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To<br />\r\nthe extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be<br />\r\nexercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the<br />\r\nfuture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rights granted cover, for example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of<br />\r\nthe Contents;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Creation of Derivative Databases;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Creation of Collective Databases;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and<br />\r\nin any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative<br />\r\nDatabases or as a part of Collective Databases; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or<br />\r\nperformance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in<br />\r\npart, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Databases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br />\r\nwhich the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br />\r\ncompulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves<br />\r\nthe exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You<br />\r\nof the rights granted under this License;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in<br />\r\nwhich the right to collect royalties through any statutory or<br />\r\ncompulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the<br />\r\nexclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of<br />\r\nthe rights granted under this License; and,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect<br />\r\nroyalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is<br />\r\na member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing<br />\r\nschemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights<br />\r\ngranted under this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop<br />\r\ndistributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that<br />\r\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice<br />\r\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section<br />\r\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4.0 Conditions of Use</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to<br />\r\nYour complying with the following conditions of use. These are important<br />\r\nconditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be<br />\r\nin material breach of its terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative<br />\r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You<br />\r\nmust:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license<br />\r\npermitted under Section 4.4;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license<br />\r\npermitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)<br />\r\nwith the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the<br />\r\nDatabase or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices<br />\r\nthat refer to this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular<br />\r\nfile due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a<br />\r\nlocation (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to<br />\r\nlook for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced<br />\r\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you<br />\r\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with<br />\r\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,<br />\r\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced<br />\r\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative<br />\r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it<br />\r\nis available under this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under<br />\r\nSection 4.3:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available here under the Open Database License (ODbL).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a<br />\r\nhyperlink to the URI of the Database. &ldquo;Open Database License&rdquo; should<br />\r\ncontain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If<br />\r\nhyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the<br />\r\nrequired URI&rsquo;s with the above notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.4 Share alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under<br />\r\nthe terms of:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. This License;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this<br />\r\nLicense; or</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. A compatible license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses<br />\r\nmentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the<br />\r\nwhole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a<br />\r\nDerivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is<br />\r\nPublicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work<br />\r\ncreated from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,<br />\r\nYou must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a<br />\r\nthat are incompatible with the rights granted under this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine<br />\r\ncompatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the<br />\r\nauthorised proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a compatible<br />\r\nlicense grants You permission to use the compatible license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.5 Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply<br />\r\nin the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license<br />\r\nCollective Databases under this License if You incorporate this<br />\r\nDatabase or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License<br />\r\nstill applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of<br />\r\nthe Collective Database;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as<br />\r\npart of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not<br />\r\ncreate a Derivative Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is<br />\r\nnot to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements<br />\r\nof Section 4.4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative<br />\r\nDatabase or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also<br />\r\noffer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy<br />\r\nin a machine readable form of:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The entire Derivative Database; or</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or<br />\r\nthe method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an<br />\r\nalgorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the<br />\r\ndifferences between the Database and the Derivative Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be<br />\r\navailable at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical<br />\r\ndistributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.7 Technological measures and additional terms</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to<br />\r\nSection 4.7 b.) any terms or any technological measures on the<br />\r\nDatabase, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of<br />\r\nthe Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any<br />\r\nrights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting<br />\r\nthe ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological<br />\r\nmeasures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a<br />\r\nSubstantial part of the Contents (a &ldquo;Restricted Database&rdquo;) in<br />\r\ncontravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the<br />\r\nDatabase or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the<br />\r\nRestricted Database:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. That is available without additional fee;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict<br />\r\nthe terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have<br />\r\nthe effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to<br />\r\nexercise those rights (an &ldquo;Unrestricted Database&rdquo;); and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the<br />\r\nrecipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a<br />\r\nDerivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a<br />\r\npassword, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You<br />\r\ndo not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights<br />\r\ngranted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the<br />\r\nability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time<br />\r\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the<br />\r\nContents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the<br />\r\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same<br />\r\nterms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for<br />\r\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may<br />\r\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are<br />\r\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made<br />\r\nby You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any<br />\r\nfurther restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed<br />\r\nunder this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.0 Moral rights</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights<br />\r\nto be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment<br />\r\nthat would otherwise prejudice the author&rsquo;s honour and reputation, or<br />\r\nany other derogatory treatment:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives<br />\r\nall moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest<br />\r\nextent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.4;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant<br />\r\njurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral<br />\r\nrights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the<br />\r\nfullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under<br />\r\nSection 10.4; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert<br />\r\nmoral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their<br />\r\nmoral rights over certain aspects of the Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral<br />\r\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some<br />\r\njurisdictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may<br />\r\nindependently have under any applicable law to make any use of this<br />\r\nDatabase, including without limitation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents<br />\r\nfrom non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for<br />\r\npurposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and<br />\r\nExtraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative<br />\r\nor judicial procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation<br />\r\nor exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract<br />\r\nand Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated<br />\r\nquantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including<br />\r\ncreating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the<br />\r\nContents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or<br />\r\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount<br />\r\nto the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the<br />\r\nContents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and without any<br />\r\nwarranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,<br />\r\ncustom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically<br />\r\ndisclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,<br />\r\nnon-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of<br />\r\nerrors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.<br />\r\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so<br />\r\nthis exclusion may not apply to You.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8.0 Limitation of liability</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,<br />\r\nthe Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability<br />\r\nfor loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use<br />\r\nunder this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused<br />\r\nby any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of<br />\r\nliability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,<br />\r\nconsequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,<br />\r\ndata, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies<br />\r\neven if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such<br />\r\ndamages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and<br />\r\ndirect financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on<br />\r\nthe part of the Licensor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License<br />\r\nautomatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without<br />\r\nnotice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the<br />\r\nDatabase, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative<br />\r\nDatabases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You<br />\r\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated provided<br />\r\ntheir use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted<br />\r\nunder Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will<br />\r\nsurvive any termination of this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor<br />\r\nwill not terminate Your rights under it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You<br />\r\nfor the duration of applicable rights in the Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and<br />\r\nconditions of this License, then your full rights under this License<br />\r\nwill be reinstated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th<br />\r\nday after cessation of breach;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless<br />\r\notherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the<br />\r\nviolation, this is the first time You have received notice of<br />\r\nviolation of this License from the Licensor, and You cure the<br />\r\nviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to<br />\r\nbe a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release<br />\r\nthe Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or<br />\r\nmaking available the Database. Releasing the Database under different<br />\r\nlicense terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not<br />\r\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is<br />\r\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this<br />\r\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as<br />\r\nstated above.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10.0 General</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or<br />\r\nunenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of<br />\r\nthe remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each<br />\r\nremaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the<br />\r\nfullest extent permitted by law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with<br />\r\nrespect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any<br />\r\nearlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to<br />\r\nthe Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be<br />\r\nentitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any<br />\r\nbreach by the Licensor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by<br />\r\nthe laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are<br />\r\nsought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under<br />\r\napplicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant<br />\r\njurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,<br />\r\nthese additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the<br />\r\nterms of this License.</p>",

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\r\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 2 -- Scope.\r\n\r\n  a. License grant.\r\n\r\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\r\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\r\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\n\r\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\r\n               in part; and\r\n\r\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\r\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\r\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\r\n          its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\r\n          6(a).\r\n\r\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\r\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\r\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\r\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\r\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\r\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\r\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\r\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\r\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\r\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\r\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       5. Downstream recipients.\r\n\r\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\r\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\r\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\r\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\r\n               Public License.\r\n\r\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\r\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\r\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\r\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\r\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\r\n               Material.\r\n\r\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\r\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\r\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\r\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\r\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\r\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\n  b. Other rights.\r\n\r\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\r\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\r\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\r\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\r\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\r\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\r\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\r\n          Public License.\r\n\r\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\r\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\r\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\r\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\r\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\r\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\r\n\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\r\nfollowing conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. Attribution.\r\n\r\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\r\n          form), You must:\r\n\r\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\r\n               with the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\r\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\r\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\r\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\r\n                    designated);\r\n\r\n                ii. a copyright notice;\r\n\r\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\r\n\r\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\r\n                    warranties;\r\n\r\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\r\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\r\n\r\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\r\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\n\r\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\r\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\r\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\n\r\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\r\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\r\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\r\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\r\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\r\n          information.\r\n\r\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\r\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\r\n          reasonably practicable.\r\n\r\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\r\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\r\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\r\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\r\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\r\n     portion of the contents of the database;\r\n\r\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\r\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\r\n\r\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\r\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\r\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\r\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\r\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\r\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\r\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\r\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\r\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\r\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\r\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\r\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\r\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\r\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\r\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\r\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\r\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\r\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\r\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\r\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\r\n     waiver of all liability.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\r\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\r\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\r\n     terminate automatically.\r\n\r\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\r\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\r\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\r\n          violation; or\r\n\r\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\n\r\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\r\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\r\n     of this Public License.\r\n\r\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\r\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\r\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\r\n     will not terminate this Public License.\r\n\r\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\r\n     License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\r\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\n\r\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\r\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\r\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\r\n\r\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\r\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\r\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\r\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\r\n\r\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\r\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\r\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\r\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\r\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\r\n     conditions.\r\n\r\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\r\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\r\n     Licensor.\r\n\r\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\r\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\r\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\r\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.",

License grant.\r\n\r\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\r\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\r\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\r\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\n\r\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\r\n               in part; and\r\n\r\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\r\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\r\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\r\n          its terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\r\n          6(a).\r\n\r\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\r\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\r\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\r\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\r\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\r\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\r\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\r\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\r\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\r\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\r\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       5. Downstream recipients.\r\n\r\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\r\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\r\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\r\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\r\n               Public License.\r\n\r\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\r\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\r\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\r\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\r\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\r\n\r\n            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\r\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\r\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\r\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\r\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\r\n               Material.\r\n\r\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\r\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\r\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\r\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\r\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\r\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\n  b. Other rights.\r\n\r\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\r\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\r\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\r\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\r\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\r\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\r\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\r\n          Public License.\r\n\r\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\r\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\r\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\r\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\r\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\r\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\r\n\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\r\nfollowing conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. Attribution.\r\n\r\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\r\n          form), You must:\r\n\r\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\r\n               with the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\r\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\r\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\r\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\r\n                    designated);\r\n\r\n                ii. a copyright notice;\r\n\r\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\r\n\r\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\r\n                    warranties;\r\n\r\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\r\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\r\n\r\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\r\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\n\r\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\r\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\r\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\n\r\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\r\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\r\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\r\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\r\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\r\n          information.\r\n\r\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\r\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\r\n          reasonably practicable.\r\n\r\n  b. ShareAlike.\r\n\r\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\r\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\r\n\r\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\r\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\r\n          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\r\n\r\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\r\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\r\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\r\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\r\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\r\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\r\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\r\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\n\r\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\r\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\r\n     portion of the contents of the database;\r\n\r\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\r\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\r\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\r\n\r\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\r\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\r\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\r\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\r\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\r\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\r\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\r\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\r\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\r\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\r\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\r\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\r\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\r\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\r\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\r\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\r\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\r\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\r\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\r\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\r\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\r\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\r\n     waiver of all liability.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\r\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\r\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\r\n     terminate automatically.\r\n\r\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\r\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\n\r\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\r\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\r\n          violation; or\r\n\r\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\n\r\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\r\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\r\n     of this Public License.\r\n\r\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\r\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\r\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\r\n     will not terminate this Public License.\r\n\r\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\r\n     License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\r\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\n\r\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\r\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\r\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\r\n\r\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\r\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\r\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\r\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\r\n\r\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\r\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\r\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\r\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\r\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\r\n     conditions.\r\n\r\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\r\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\r\n     Licensor.\r\n\r\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\r\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\r\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\r\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.",

    "text_content": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\r\n\r\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\r\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n                            Preamble\r\n\r\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\r\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\r\n\r\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\r\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\r\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\r\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\r\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\r\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\r\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\r\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\r\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\r\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\r\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\r\nknow their rights.\r\n\r\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\r\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\r\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\r\n\r\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\r\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\r\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\r\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\r\nauthors of previous versions.\r\n\r\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\r\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\r\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\r\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\r\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\r\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\r\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\r\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\r\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\r\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\r\n\r\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\r\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\r\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\r\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\r\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\r\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n  0. Definitions.\r\n\r\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\r\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\r\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\r\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\r\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\r\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\r\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\r\n\r\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\r\non the Program.\r\n\r\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\r\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\r\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\r\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\r\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\r\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\r\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\r\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\r\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\r\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\r\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\r\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\r\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\r\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\r\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n  1. Source Code.\r\n\r\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\r\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\r\nform of a work.\r\n\r\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\r\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\r\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\r\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\r\n\r\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\r\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\r\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\r\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\r\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\r\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\r\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\r\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\r\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\r\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\r\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\r\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\r\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\r\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\r\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\r\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\r\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\r\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\r\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\r\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\r\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\r\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\r\nSource.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\r\nsame work.\r\n\r\n  2. Basic Permissions.\r\n\r\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\r\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\r\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\r\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\r\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\r\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\r\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\r\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\r\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\r\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\r\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\r\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\r\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\r\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\r\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\r\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\r\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\r\nmakes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\n\r\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\r\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\r\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\r\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\r\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\r\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\r\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\r\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\r\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\r\ntechnological measures.\r\n\r\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\n\r\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\r\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\r\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\r\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\r\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\r\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\r\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\r\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\r\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\r\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\r\n\r\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\r\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\r\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\r\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\r\n\r\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\r\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\r\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\r\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\r\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\r\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\r\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\n\r\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\r\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\r\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\r\n    work need not make them do so.\r\n\r\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\r\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\r\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\r\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\r\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\r\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\r\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\r\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\r\nparts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\r\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\r\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\r\nin one of these ways:\r\n\r\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\r\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\r\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\r\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\r\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\r\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\r\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\r\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\r\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\r\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\r\n\r\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\r\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\r\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\r\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\r\n    with subsection 6b.\r\n\r\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\r\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\r\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\r\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\r\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\r\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\r\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\r\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\r\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\r\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\r\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\n\r\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\r\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\r\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\r\n    charge under subsection 6d.\r\n\r\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\r\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\r\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\r\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\r\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\r\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\r\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\r\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\r\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\r\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\r\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\r\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\r\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\r\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\r\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\r\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\r\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\r\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\r\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\r\nmodification has been made.\r\n\r\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\r\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\r\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\r\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\r\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\r\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\r\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\r\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\r\nbeen installed in ROM).\r\n\r\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\r\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\r\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\r\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\r\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\r\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\r\nprotocols for communication across the network.\r\n\r\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\r\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\r\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\r\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\r\nunpacking, reading or copying.\r\n\r\n  7. Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\r\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\r\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\r\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\r\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\r\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\r\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\r\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\r\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\r\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\r\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\r\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\r\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\r\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\r\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\r\n\r\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\r\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\r\n\r\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\r\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\r\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\r\n\r\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\r\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\r\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\r\n\r\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\r\n    authors of the material; or\r\n\r\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\r\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\r\n\r\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\r\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\r\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\r\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\r\n    those licensors and authors.\r\n\r\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\r\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\r\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\r\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\r\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\r\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\r\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\r\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\r\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\r\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\r\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\r\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\r\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\r\nthe above requirements apply either way.\r\n\r\n  8. Termination.\r\n\r\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\r\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\r\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\r\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\r\nparagraph of section 11).\r\n\r\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\r\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\r\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\r\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\r\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\r\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\r\nyour receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\r\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\r\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\r\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\r\nmaterial under section 10.\r\n\r\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\n\r\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\r\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\r\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\r\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\r\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\r\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\r\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\r\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\r\n\r\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\n\r\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\r\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\r\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\r\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\r\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\r\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\r\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\r\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\r\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\r\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\r\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\r\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\r\n\r\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\r\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\r\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\r\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\r\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\r\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n  11. Patents.\r\n\r\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\r\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\r\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\r\n\r\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\r\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\r\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\r\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\r\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\r\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\r\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\r\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\r\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\r\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\r\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\r\n\r\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\r\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\r\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\r\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\r\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\r\npatent against the party.\r\n\r\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\r\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\r\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\r\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\r\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\r\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\r\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\r\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\r\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\r\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\r\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\r\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\r\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\r\n\r\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\r\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\r\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\r\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\r\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\r\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\r\nwork and works based on it.\r\n\r\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\r\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\r\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\r\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\r\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\r\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\r\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\r\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\r\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\r\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\r\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\r\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\r\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\r\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\r\n\r\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\r\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\r\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\r\n\r\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\r\n\r\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\r\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\r\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\r\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\r\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\r\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\r\n\r\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\r\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\r\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\r\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\r\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\r\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\r\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\r\ncombination as such.\r\n\r\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\r\n\r\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\r\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\r\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\r\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\r\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\r\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\r\nby the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\r\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\r\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\r\nto choose that version for the Program.\r\n\r\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\r\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\r\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\r\nlater version.\r\n\r\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\r\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\r\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\r\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\r\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\r\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\r\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\r\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\r\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\r\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\r\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\r\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\r\nSUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\r\n\r\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\r\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\r\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\r\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\r\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\r\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\r\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\r\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\r\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\r\n\r\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\r\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\r\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\r\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\n\r\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\r\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\r\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\r\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\r\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.",
    "html_content": "<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n &lt;<a href=\"https://fsf.org/\">https://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p><p>\r\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"preamble\"></a>Preamble</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\r\nsoftware and other kinds of works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\r\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\r\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\r\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\r\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\r\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\r\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\r\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\r\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\r\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\r\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\r\nknow their rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\r\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\r\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\r\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\r\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\r\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\r\nauthors of previous versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\r\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\r\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\r\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\r\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\r\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\r\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\r\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\r\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\r\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\r\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\r\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\r\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\r\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\r\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"terms\"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section0\"></a>0. Definitions.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\r\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\r\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and\r\n&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\r\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\r\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the\r\nearlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based\r\non the Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without\r\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\r\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\r\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\r\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\r\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\r\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\r\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo;\r\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\r\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\r\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\r\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\r\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\r\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\r\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section1\"></a>1. Source Code.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work\r\nfor making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source\r\nform of a work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official\r\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\r\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\r\nis widely used among developers working in that language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other\r\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\r\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\r\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\r\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\r\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\r\n&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component\r\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\r\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\r\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all\r\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\r\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\r\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\r\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\r\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\r\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\r\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\r\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\r\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\r\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\r\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\r\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\r\nSource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\r\nsame work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section2\"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\r\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\r\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\r\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\r\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\r\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\r\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\r\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\r\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\r\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\r\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\r\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\r\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\r\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\r\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\r\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\r\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\r\nmakes it unnecessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section3\"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\r\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\r\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\r\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\r\nmeasures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\r\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\r\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\r\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\r\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\r\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\r\ntechnological measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section4\"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\r\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\r\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\r\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\r\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\r\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\r\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section5\"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\r\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\r\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\r\n    it, and giving a relevant date.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\r\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\r\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\r\n    &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\r\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\r\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\r\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\r\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\r\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\r\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\r\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\r\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\r\n    work need not make them do so.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\r\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\r\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\r\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\r\n&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\r\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\r\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\r\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\r\nparts of the aggregate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section6\"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\r\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\r\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\r\nin one of these ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\r\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\r\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\r\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\r\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\r\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\r\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\r\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\r\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\r\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\r\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\r\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\r\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\r\n    with subsection 6b.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\r\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\r\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\r\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\r\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\r\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\r\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\r\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\r\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\r\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\r\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\r\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\r\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\r\n    charge under subsection 6d.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\r\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\r\nincluded in conveying the object code work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any\r\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\r\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\r\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\r\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\r\nproduct received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a\r\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\r\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\r\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\r\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\r\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\r\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,\r\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\r\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\r\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\r\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\r\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\r\nmodification has been made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\r\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\r\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\r\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\r\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\r\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\r\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\r\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\r\nbeen installed in ROM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\r\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\r\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\r\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\r\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\r\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\r\nprotocols for communication across the network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\r\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\r\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\r\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\r\nunpacking, reading or copying.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section7\"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this\r\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\r\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\r\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\r\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\r\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\r\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\r\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\r\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\r\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\r\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\r\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\r\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\r\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\r\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\r\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>\r\n\r\n<li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\r\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\r\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>\r\n\r\n<li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\r\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\r\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>\r\n\r\n<li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\r\n    authors of the material; or</li>\r\n\r\n<li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\r\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>\r\n\r\n<li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\r\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\r\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\r\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\r\n    those licensors and authors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further\r\nrestrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\r\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\r\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\r\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\r\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\r\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\r\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\r\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\r\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\r\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\r\nwhere to find the applicable terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\r\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\r\nthe above requirements apply either way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section8\"></a>8. Termination.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\r\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\r\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\r\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\r\nparagraph of section 11).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\r\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\r\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\r\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\r\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\r\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\r\nyour receipt of the notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\r\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\r\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\r\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\r\nmaterial under section 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section9\"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\r\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\r\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\r\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\r\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\r\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\r\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\r\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section10\"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\r\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\r\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\r\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an\r\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\r\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\r\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\r\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\r\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\r\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\r\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\r\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\r\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\r\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\r\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\r\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\r\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section11\"></a>11. Patents.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\r\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\r\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims\r\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\r\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\r\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\r\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\r\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\r\npurposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant\r\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\r\nthis License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\r\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\r\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\r\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express\r\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\r\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\r\nsue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a\r\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\r\npatent against the party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\r\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\r\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\r\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\r\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\r\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\r\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\r\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\r\nlicense to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have\r\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\r\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\r\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\r\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\r\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\r\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\r\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\r\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\r\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\r\nwork and works based on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within\r\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\r\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\r\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\r\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\r\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\r\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\r\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\r\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\r\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\r\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\r\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\r\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\r\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\r\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\r\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section12\"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\r\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\r\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\r\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\r\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\r\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section13\"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\r\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\r\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\r\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\r\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\r\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\r\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\r\ncombination as such.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section14\"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\r\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\r\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\r\nPublic License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the\r\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\r\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\r\nby the Free Software Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\r\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\r\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\r\nto choose that version for the Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different\r\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\r\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\r\nlater version.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section15\"></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\r\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY\r\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\r\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\r\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\r\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section16\"></a>16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\r\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\r\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\r\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\r\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\r\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\r\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\r\nSUCH DAMAGES.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"section17\"></a>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\r\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\r\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\r\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\r\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\r\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"howto\"></a>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\r\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, your program's commands\r\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\r\nif any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if necessary.\r\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\r\n&lt;<a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/\">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>&gt;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\r\ninto proprietary programs.

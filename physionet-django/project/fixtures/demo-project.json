    "section_content": "<p>In recent years there has been a concerted move towards the adoption of digital health record systems in hospitals. In the US, for example, the number of non-federal acute care hospitals with basic digital systems increased from 9.4 to 75.5% over the 7 year period between 2008 and 2014 [1].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite this advance, interoperability of digital systems remains an open issue, leading to challenges in data integration. As a result, the potential that hospital data offers in terms of understanding and improving care is yet to be fully realized. In parallel, the scientific research community is increasingly coming under criticism for the lack of reproducibility of studies [2].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we report the release of the MIMIC-III database [3], an update to the widely-used MIMIC-II database. MIMIC-III integrates deidentified, comprehensive clinical data of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, and makes it widely accessible to researchers internationally under a data use agreement. The open nature of the data allows clinical studies to be reproduced and improved in ways that would not otherwise be possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on our experience with the previous major release of MIMIC (MIMIC-II, released in 2010) we anticipate MIMIC-III to be widely used internationally in areas such as academic and industrial research, quality improvement initiatives, and higher education coursework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To recognize the increasingly broad usage of MIMIC, we have renamed the full title of the database from &lsquo;Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care&rsquo; to &lsquo;Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care&rsquo;. The MIMIC-III critical care database is unique and notable for the following reasons:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>it is the only freely accessible critical care database of its kind</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>the dataset spans more than a decade, with detailed information about individual patient care</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>analysis is unrestricted once a data use agreement is accepted, enabling clinical research and education around the world.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>"

    "section_content": "<p>The Laboratory for Computational Physiology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology is an interdisciplinary team of data scientists and practicing physicians. MIMIC-III is the third iteration of the MIMIC critical care database, enabling us to draw upon prior experience with regard to data management and integration</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Database development</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MIMIC-III database was populated with data that had been acquired during routine hospital care, so there was no associated burden on caregivers and no interference with their workflow. Data was downloaded from several sources, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>archives from critical care information systems.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>hospital electronic health record databases.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Social Security Administration Death Master File.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Two different critical care information systems were in place over the data collection period: Philips CareVue Clinical Information System (models M2331A and M1215A; Philips Health-care, Andover, MA) and iMDsoft MetaVision ICU (iMDsoft, Needham, MA). These systems were the source of clinical data such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>time-stamped nurse-verified physiological measurements (for example, hourly documentation of heart rate, arterial blood pressure, or respiratory rate);</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>documented progress notes by care providers;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>continuous intravenous drip medications and fluid balances.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With exception to data relating to fluid intake, which differed significantly in structure between the CareVue and MetaVision systems, data was merged when building the database tables. Data which could not be merged is given a suffix to denote the data source. For example, inputs for patients monitored with the CareVue system are stored in INPUTEVENTS_CV, whereas inputs for patients monitored with the Metavision system are stored in INPUTEVENTS_MV. Additional information was collected from hospital and laboratory health record systems, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>patient demographics and in-hospital mortality.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>laboratory test results (for example, hematology, chemistry, and microbiology results).</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>discharge summaries and reports of electrocardiogram and imaging studies.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>billing-related information such as International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition (ICD-9) codes, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Out-of-hospital mortality dates were obtained using the Social Security Administration Death Master File. A more detailed description of the data is shown in Table 1. Physiological waveforms obtained from bedside monitors (such as electrocardiograms, blood pressure waveforms, photoplethysmograms, impedance pneumograms) were obtained for a subset of patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several projects are ongoing to map concepts within the MIMIC database to standardized dictionaries. For example, researchers at the National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health have mapped laboratory tests and medications in MIMIC-II to LOINC and RxNorm, respectively<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635#ref4\" id=\"ref-link-section-4\" title=\" Abhyankar, S., Demner-Fushman, D. &amp; McDonald, C. J. Standardizing clinical laboratory data for secondary use. J Biomed Inform 45, 642\u2013650 (2012). \">4</a>. Efforts are also underway to transform MIMIC to common data models, such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, to support the application of standardized tools and methods<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635#ref5\" id=\"ref-link-section-5\" title=\" Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Website http://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/(Accessed: March 2016). \">5</a>. These developments are progressively incorporated into the MIMIC database where possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA). Requirement for individual patient consent was waived because the project did not impact clinical care and all protected health information was deidentified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Deidentification</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before data was incorporated into the MIMIC-III database, it was first deidentified in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards using structured data cleansing and date shifting. The deidentification process for structured data required the removal of all eighteen of the identifying data elements listed in HIPAA, including fields such as patient name, telephone number, address, and dates. In particular, dates were shifted into the future by a random offset for each individual patient in a consistent manner to preserve intervals, resulting in stays which occur sometime between the years 2100 and 2200. Time of day, day of the week, and approximate seasonality were conserved during date shifting. Dates of birth for patients aged over 89 were shifted to obscure their true age and comply with HIPAA regulations: these patients appear in the database with ages of over 300 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protected health information was removed from free text fields, such as diagnostic reports and physician notes, using a rigorously evaluated deidentification system based on extensive dictionary look-ups and pattern-matching with regular expressions. The components of this deidentification system are continually expanded as new data is acquired.</p>"

In addition, it contains data for 7870 neonates admitted between 2001 and 2008. The data covers 38,597 distinct adult patients and 49,785 hospital admissions. The median age of adult patients is 65.8 years (Q1&ndash;Q3: 52.8&ndash;77.8), 55.9% patients are male, and in-hospital mortality is 11.5%. The median length of an ICU stay is 2.1 days (Q1&ndash;Q3: 1.2&ndash;4.6) and the median length of a hospital stay is 6.9 days (Q1-Q3: 4.1&ndash;11.9). A mean of 4579 charted observations (&rsquo;chartevents&rsquo;) and 380 laboratory measurements (&rsquo;labevents&rsquo;) are available for each hospital admission. Table 1 provides a breakdown of the adult population by care unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Details of the MIMIC-III patient population by first critical care unit on hospital admission for patients aged 16 years and above.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes from the patient discharges are listed in Table 2. The top three codes across hospital admissions for patients aged 16 years and above were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Distribution of primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition (ICD-9) codes by care unit for patients aged 16 years and above.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>414.01 (&lsquo;Coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary artery&rsquo;), accounting for 7.1% of all hospital admissions;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>038.9 (&lsquo;Unspecified septicemia&rsquo;), accounting for 4.2% of all hospital admissions; and</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>410.71 (&lsquo;Subendocardial infarction, initial episode of care&rsquo;), accounting for 3.6% of all hospital admissions.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Classes of data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data available in the MIMIC-III database ranges from time-stamped, nurse-verified physiological measurements made at the bedside to free-text interpretations of imaging studies provided by the radiology department. Table 3 gives an overview of the different classes of data available. Figure 2 shows sample data for a single patient stay in a medical intensive care unit. The patient, who was undergoing a course of chemotherapy at the time of admission, presented with febrile neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GCS is Glasgow Coma Scale; NIBP is non-invasive blood pressure; and O2 saturation is blood oxygen saturation.</p>"

One of the first major products of that effort was the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which we completed and began distributing in 1980. The database was the first generally available set of standard test material for evaluation of arrhythmia detectors, and has been used for that purpose as well as for basic research into cardiac dynamics at more than 500 sites worldwide. Originally, we distributed the database on 9-track half-inch digital tape at 800 and 1600 bpi, and on quarter-inch IRIG-format FM analog tape. In August, 1989, we produced a CD-ROM version of the database.</p>"

    "abstract": "<p>The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database contains 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings, obtained from 47 subjects studied by the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory between 1975 and 1979. Twenty-three recordings were chosen at random from a set of 4000 24-hour ambulatory ECG recordings collected from a mixed population of inpatients (about 60%) and outpatients (about 40%) at Boston&#39;s Beth Israel Hospital; the remaining 25 recordings were selected from the same set to include less common but clinically significant arrhythmias that would not be well-represented in a small random sample.</p>",
    "background": "<p>Since 1975, our laboratories at Boston&#39;s Beth Israel Hospital (now the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) and at MIT have supported our own research into arrhythmia analysis and related subjects. One of the first major products of that effort was the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which we completed and began distributing in 1980. The database was the first generally available set of standard test material for evaluation of arrhythmia detectors, and has been used for that purpose as well as for basic research into cardiac dynamics at more than 500 sites worldwide. Originally, we distributed the database on 9-track half-inch digital tape at 800 and 1600 bpi, and on quarter-inch IRIG-format FM analog tape. In August, 1989, we produced a CD-ROM version of the database.</p>",
    "methods": "<p>The recordings were digitized at 360 samples per second per channel with 11-bit resolution over a 10 mV range. Two or more cardiologists independently annotated each record; disagreements were resolved to obtain the computer-readable reference annotations for each beat (approximately 110,000 annotations in all) included with the database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The charts for each recording were given to two cardiologists, who worked independently, adding additional beat labels and deleting false detections as necessary, and changing the labels for abnormal beats. The cardiologists also added rhythm and signal quality labels. At this point the two sets of annotations were compared automatically and another chart recording was printed, showing the cardiologists&rsquo; annotations in the margin, with all discrepancies highlighted. Each discrepancy was examined and resolved by consensus.</p>",

About half (25 of 48 complete records, and reference annotation files for all 48 records) of this database has been freely available here since PhysioNet&#39;s inception in September 1999. The 23 remaining signal files, which had been available only on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database CD-ROM, were posted here in February 2005.</p>",

    "title": "MIMIC-III Clinical Database",
    "abstract": "<p>MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign measurements made at the bedside (~1 data point per hour), laboratory test results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, and mortality (both in and out of hospital).</p>",
    "background": "<p>In recent years there has been a concerted move towards the adoption of digital health record systems in hospitals. In the US, for example, the number of non-federal acute care hospitals with basic digital systems increased from 9.4 to 75.5% over the 7 year period between 2008 and 2014 [1].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite this advance, interoperability of digital systems remains an open issue, leading to challenges in data integration. As a result, the potential that hospital data offers in terms of understanding and improving care is yet to be fully realized. In parallel, the scientific research community is increasingly coming under criticism for the lack of reproducibility of studies [2].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we report the release of the MIMIC-III database [3], an update to the widely-used MIMIC-II database. MIMIC-III integrates deidentified, comprehensive clinical data of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, and makes it widely accessible to researchers internationally under a data use agreement. The open nature of the data allows clinical studies to be reproduced and improved in ways that would not otherwise be possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on our experience with the previous major release of MIMIC (MIMIC-II, released in 2010) we anticipate MIMIC-III to be widely used internationally in areas such as academic and industrial research, quality improvement initiatives, and higher education coursework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To recognize the increasingly broad usage of MIMIC, we have renamed the full title of the database from &lsquo;Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care&rsquo; to &lsquo;Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care&rsquo;. The MIMIC-III critical care database is unique and notable for the following reasons:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>it is the only freely accessible critical care database of its kind</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>the dataset spans more than a decade, with detailed information about individual patient care</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>analysis is unrestricted once a data use agreement is accepted, enabling clinical research and education around the world.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>",
    "methods": "<p>The Laboratory for Computational Physiology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology is an interdisciplinary team of data scientists and practicing physicians. MIMIC-III is the third iteration of the MIMIC critical care database, enabling us to draw upon prior experience with regard to data management and integration</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Database development</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MIMIC-III database was populated with data that had been acquired during routine hospital care, so there was no associated burden on caregivers and no interference with their workflow. Data was downloaded from several sources, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>archives from critical care information systems.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>hospital electronic health record databases.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Social Security Administration Death Master File.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Two different critical care information systems were in place over the data collection period: Philips CareVue Clinical Information System (models M2331A and M1215A; Philips Health-care, Andover, MA) and iMDsoft MetaVision ICU (iMDsoft, Needham, MA). These systems were the source of clinical data such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>time-stamped nurse-verified physiological measurements (for example, hourly documentation of heart rate, arterial blood pressure, or respiratory rate);</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>documented progress notes by care providers;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>continuous intravenous drip medications and fluid balances.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With exception to data relating to fluid intake, which differed significantly in structure between the CareVue and MetaVision systems, data was merged when building the database tables. Data which could not be merged is given a suffix to denote the data source. For example, inputs for patients monitored with the CareVue system are stored in INPUTEVENTS_CV, whereas inputs for patients monitored with the Metavision system are stored in INPUTEVENTS_MV. Additional information was collected from hospital and laboratory health record systems, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>patient demographics and in-hospital mortality.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>laboratory test results (for example, hematology, chemistry, and microbiology results).</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>discharge summaries and reports of electrocardiogram and imaging studies.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>billing-related information such as International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition (ICD-9) codes, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Out-of-hospital mortality dates were obtained using the Social Security Administration Death Master File. A more detailed description of the data is shown in Table 1. Physiological waveforms obtained from bedside monitors (such as electrocardiograms, blood pressure waveforms, photoplethysmograms, impedance pneumograms) were obtained for a subset of patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several projects are ongoing to map concepts within the MIMIC database to standardized dictionaries. For example, researchers at the National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health have mapped laboratory tests and medications in MIMIC-II to LOINC and RxNorm, respectively<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635#ref4\" id=\"ref-link-section-4\" title=\" Abhyankar, S., Demner-Fushman, D. &amp; McDonald, C. J. Standardizing clinical laboratory data for secondary use. J Biomed Inform 45, 642\u2013650 (2012). \">4</a>. Efforts are also underway to transform MIMIC to common data models, such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, to support the application of standardized tools and methods<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635#ref5\" id=\"ref-link-section-5\" title=\" Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Website http://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/(Accessed: March 2016). \">5</a>. These developments are progressively incorporated into the MIMIC database where possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA). Requirement for individual patient consent was waived because the project did not impact clinical care and all protected health information was deidentified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Deidentification</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before data was incorporated into the MIMIC-III database, it was first deidentified in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards using structured data cleansing and date shifting. The deidentification process for structured data required the removal of all eighteen of the identifying data elements listed in HIPAA, including fields such as patient name, telephone number, address, and dates. In particular, dates were shifted into the future by a random offset for each individual patient in a consistent manner to preserve intervals, resulting in stays which occur sometime between the years 2100 and 2200. Time of day, day of the week, and approximate seasonality were conserved during date shifting. Dates of birth for patients aged over 89 were shifted to obscure their true age and comply with HIPAA regulations: these patients appear in the database with ages of over 300 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protected health information was removed from free text fields, such as diagnostic reports and physician notes, using a rigorously evaluated deidentification system based on extensive dictionary look-ups and pattern-matching with regular expressions. The components of this deidentification system are continually expanded as new data is acquired.</p>",
    "content_description": "<p><strong>Patient characteristics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MIMIC-III contains data associated with 53,423 distinct hospital admissions for adult patients (aged 16 years or above) admitted to critical care units between 2001 and 2012. In addition, it contains data for 7870 neonates admitted between 2001 and 2008. The data covers 38,597 distinct adult patients and 49,785 hospital admissions. The median age of adult patients is 65.8 years (Q1&ndash;Q3: 52.8&ndash;77.8), 55.9% patients are male, and in-hospital mortality is 11.5%. The median length of an ICU stay is 2.1 days (Q1&ndash;Q3: 1.2&ndash;4.6) and the median length of a hospital stay is 6.9 days (Q1-Q3: 4.1&ndash;11.9). A mean of 4579 charted observations (&rsquo;chartevents&rsquo;) and 380 laboratory measurements (&rsquo;labevents&rsquo;) are available for each hospital admission.

    "usage_notes": "<p>Data from each patient is collected into a common warehouse only if certain &ldquo;interfaces&rdquo; are available.

These downtimes are in principle rare, but an empirical study on how frequently this occurs is yet to be undertaken.</li>\r\n</ul>",

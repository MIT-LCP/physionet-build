The noise recordings were made using physically active volunteers and standard ECG recorders, leads, and electrodes; the electrodes were placed on the limbs in positions in which the subjects&rsquo; ECGs were not visible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The three noise records were assembled from the recordings by selecting intervals that contained predominantly baseline wander (in record &#39;bw&#39;), muscle (EMG) artifact (in record &#39;ma&#39;), and electrode motion artifact (in record &#39;em&#39;). Electrode motion artifact is generally considered the most troublesome, since it can mimic the appearance of ectopic beats and cannot be removed easily by simple filters, as can noise of other types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECG recordings were created by the script <a href=\"nstdbgen-\">nstdbgen-</a> using two clean recordings (118 and 119) from the <a href=\"../mitdb/\">MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database</a>, to which calibrated amounts of noise from record &#39;em&#39; were added using <a href=\"/physiotools/wag/nst-1.htm\">nst</a>. (The process of making such records is now simpler; the simplified script <a href=\"nstdbgen\">nstdbgen</a> can be used with current versions of the <a href=\"/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB software package</a> to recreate these records.) Noise was added beginning after the first 5 minutes of each record, during two-minute segments alternating with two-minute clean segments. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) during the noisy segments of these records are:</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Record</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>SNR (dB)</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Record</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>SNR (dB)</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>118e24</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>24</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>119e24</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>24</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>118e18</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>18</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>119e18</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>18</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>118e12</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>12</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>119e12</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>12</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>118e06</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>119e06</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>118e00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>0</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>119e00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>0</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>118e_6</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>-6</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>119e_6</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>-6</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the original ECG recordings are clean, the correct beat annotations are known even when the noise makes the recordings visually unreadable.

The first column is the heart rate, the second is the chest volume (respiration force), and the third is the blood oxygen concentration (measured by ear oximetry). The sampling frequency for each measurement is 2 Hz (i.e., the time interval between measurements in successive rows is 0.5 seconds).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heart rate was determined by locating the QRS complexes using an automated beat detector, measuring the RR intervals (the time intervals between successive QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram), taking the reciprocals, and then converting the series of reciprocals to a series with samples at equal time intervals by interpolation using <a href=\"/physiotools/wag/tach-1.htm\">tach</a>. There were no abnormal beats (sudden changes in the heart rate are not artifacts).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The respiration and blood oxygen data are given in uncalibrated analog-to-digital converter units. These two sensors slowly drift with time (and are therefore occasionally rescaled by a technician) and can be detached by the motion of the patient, hence their calibration is not constant over the data set. These signals were originally sampled at 250 Hz; the 2 Hz samples given here were derived by summing 20 samples (80 milliseconds) of each original signal in windows centered on the times corresponding to the heart rate samples. (The description written in 1991 to accompany this data set stated erroneously that these samples were averages rather than sums. The method used for summation was not recorded, but it apparently included additional steps since sums of 20 samples from the original record do not exactly match those recorded in these files. Thanks to Takayoshi Shiraki of the University of Tokyo for reporting that the samples are not averages and that they closely approximate sums.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between roughly 4 hours 30 minutes and 4 hours 34 minutes from the start of the file, the sensors were disconnected.

Sleep apnea is medically important because it leads to sleep deprivation and occasionally death. There are three primary research questions associated with this data set:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Can part of the temporal variation in the heart rate be explained by a low-dimensional mechanism, or is it due to noise or external inputs?</li>\r\n\t<li>How do the evolution of the heart rate, the respiration rate, and the blood oxygen concentration affect each other? (A correlation between breathing and the heart rate, called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, is almost always observed.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Can the episodes of sleep apnea (stoppage of breathing) be predicted from the preceding data?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reason for choice:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Heart rate variability</strong><br />\r\n\tThere is growing (but still controversial) evidence that the observed variations in the heart rate might be related to a low-dimensional governing mechanism; understanding this mechanism is obviously very important in order to understand its failures (i.e., heart attacks).</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Multi-dimensional data sets</strong><br />\r\n\tThese data provide simultaneous measurements of a number of potentially interacting variables; it is an open question how best to use the extra information to learn about how the variables interact. Most importantly, there is interest in verifying and understanding the coupling between respiration and the heart rate.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Non-stationary data</strong><br />\r\n\tThese data were recorded with as much care as is possible, but the experimental system (the sleeping patient) is obviously non-stationary. A successful analysis of these data must attempt to distinguish the presumed internal dynamics from changes in the patient&amp;rsdquo;s state.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Citations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This data set is described in:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rigney DR, Goldberger AL, Ocasio WC, Ichimaru Y, Moody GB, and Mark RG. &quot;Multi-channel physiological data: description and analysis&quot;, in <em>Time Series Prediction: Forecasting the Future and Understanding the Past</em>, A.S.

The files with names of the form <em>rnn</em>.dat contain the digitized ECGs (16 bits per sample, least significant byte first in each pair, 100 samples per second, nominally 200 A/D units per millivolt). The .hea files are (text) header files that specify the names and formats of the associated signal files; these header files are needed by the software available from this site. The .apn files are (binary) annotation files, containing an annotation for each minute of each recording indicating the presence or absence of apnea at that time; these are available for the 35 learning set recordings only. The qrs files are machine-generated (binary) annotation files, made using <a href=\"/physiotools/wag/sqrs-1.htm\">sqrs125</a>, and provided for the convenience of those who do not wish to use their own QRS detectors. Please note that the .qrs files are unaudited and contain errors. You may wish to correct these errors (if you do, please <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org\">send your corrections to us</a>). Otherwise, you may use these annotations in uncorrected form if you wish to investigate methods of apnea detection that are robust with respect to small numbers of QRS detection errors, or you may ignore these annotations entirely and work directly from the signal files.

The slightly different descriptions of these records in <a href=\"additional-information.txt\">additional-information.txt</a> suggest that c06 may have been a corrected version of c05.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eight records that include respiration signals have several additional files each. The four respiration-related signals are combined in a file named <em>rnn</em>r.dat, which has its own header file (<em>rnn</em>r.hea), as well as a header file named <em>rnn</em>er.hea, which (when used with software such as <a href=\"/physiotools/wug/\">WAVE</a> or <a href=\"/physiotools/old/dbag/wview-1.htm\"> WVIEW</a>) allows you to examine the ECG and the respiration signals side-by-side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, if you are running Linux and have installed WAVE, you may click on the .xws file associated with each record to view that record without downloading it first.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The MIMIC Database includes data recorded from over 90 ICU patients. The data in each case include signals and periodic measurements obtained from a bedside monitor as well as clinical data obtained from the patient&#39;s medical record. The recordings vary in length; almost all of them are at least 20 hours, and many are 40 hours or more. In all, the database contains nearly 200 patient-days of real-time signals and accompanying data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each record typically consists of several hundred individual files. The data obtained from the bedside monitors are divided into files each containing 10 minutes of recorded signals, which can then be assembled without gaps to form a continuous recording. For this reason, each record is kept in a separate directory, named after the record it contains. Follow the links below to reach the data files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that there are several annotation sets associated with most MIMIC Database records. These include qrs (ECG beat labels, all beats labelled normal) for all records; al (annotations for <a href=\"alarm-types.shtml\">alarms</a> related to changes in the patient&#39;s status) and in (annotations related to changes in the functioning of the monitor) for all records after 055; and abp (arterial blood pressure), pap (pulmonary arterial pressure), cvp (central venous pressure), and ple (fingertip plethysmograph) annotations for those records in which the corresponding signals are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information about the MIMIC Database, see Moody GB, Mark RG, <a href=\"mimic-cic96/mimic.html\"><em>A Database to Support Development and Evaluation of Intelligent Intensive Care Monitoring</em></a>, Computers in Cardiology 1996; 657-660. The <a href=\"/physiotools/record/\">software</a> used to record the data contained in the MIMIC Database is available here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>MIMIC Database Records</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Numerics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The periodic measurements (&quot;numerics&quot;) for the entire MIMIC Database (121 records, including multiple recordings of some subjects) are available <a href=\"numerics\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Complete records</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since each MIMIC Database record is stored in its own directory (which has the same base name as the record), you will need to use a special format for the record names if you use PhysioToolkit software to read these data directly from the PhysioNet web server. For example, to read the alarm annotations for record 411, use a command such as</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>rdann -r mimicdb/411/411 -a al </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that 411 appears twice in this command, first to specify a directory, and again to specify the base record name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An <a href=\"mimic-index.shtml\">index</a> of the MIMIC Database, indicating the clinical class of each subject, and the duration and contents of each record, is available here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Related Databases</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Were you looking for the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2cdb/\">MIMIC-II Database</a> or the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic3cdb/\">MIMIC-III Database</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The database described below was the product of our first attempt (1992-1999) to build a collection of multi-parameter recordings of ICU patients. We learned a lot from this project, and have been able to do much more in the MIMIC project (2001-present), particularly in collection of clinical data. The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2cdb/\">MIMIC-II Database</a> and the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic3cdb/\">MIMIC-III Database</a> are many times the size of the original MIMIC Database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the only advantage of MIMIC over MIMIC II is that the ECG signals in MIMIC were recorded at 500 samples per second with 12-bit precision and negligible jitter, whereas those in MIMIC II contain 125 &quot;peak-picked&quot; samples per second with 8- or 10-bit precision and &plusmn;6 ms jitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This PhysioBank database contains 72 complete records together with periodic measurements (&quot;numerics&quot;) for all 121 records of MIMIC, including multiple recordings of some of the 90 subjects. The lengths of these records vary, but average about 40 hours each. The PhysioNet core collection includes records 037, 039, and 041, as well as the numerics for all 121 records; the other available records are available from the master PhysioNet server and from some mirrors.</p>",

Subsequently, the time between foot-strikes was automatically computed. The method for determining the stride interval is a modification of a previously validated method that has been shown to agree with force-platform measures, a &ldquo;gold&rdquo; standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data were collected from the healthy subjects as they walked in a roughly circular path for 15 minutes, and from the subjects with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease as they walked for 6 minutes up and down a long hallway.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may download <a href=\"gait-data.tar\">gait-data.tar</a> (150K), a UNIX tar archive of this entire mini-collection, also available in gzip-compressed form as <a href=\"gait-data.tar.gz\">gait-data.tar.gz</a> ( 47K).

The original analog recordings were made at Boston&#39;s Beth Israel Hospital (now the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) using ambulatory ECG recorders with a typical recording bandwidth of approximately 0.1 Hz to 40 Hz. The rhythm annotation files (with the suffix .atr) were prepared manually; these contain rhythm annotations of types (AFIB (atrial fibrillation), (AFL (atrial flutter), (J (AV junctional rhythm), and (N (used to indicate all other rhythms). (The original rhythm annotation files, still available in the <a href=\"old/\">old</a> directory, used AF, AFL, J, and N to mark these rhythms; the atr annotations in this directory have been revised for consistency with those used for the <a href=\"../mitdb/\">MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database</a>.) Beat annotation files (with the suffix .qrs) were prepared using an automated detector and have not been corrected manually. For some records, manually corrected beat annotation files (with the suffix .qrsc) are available. (The .qrs annotations may be useful for studies of methods for automated AF detection, where such methods must be robust with respect to typical QRS detection errors. The .qrsc annotations may be preferred for basic studies of AF itself, where QRS detection errors would be confounding.) Note that in both .qrs and .qrsc files, no distinction is made among beat types (all beats are labelled as if normal).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Release Info</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Until November 2000, only one of the signal files (for record 04936) was available. The original 9-track tapes from 1983 for these records have now been read to produce the other signal files in this directory. In a few cases (04043, 08405, and 08434) isolated data blocks from the original tapes were unreadable. In these cases, the missing data, corresponding to 10.24 seconds for each missing block, have been replaced with a flat segment of samples with amplitudes of zero. See <a href=\"notes.txt\">notes.txt</a> for details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2014, Henian Xia reported that the .qrs annotations were not aligned with the ECG waveforms in record 07859, and investigation showed that 2569 samples appeared to be missing from the beginning of the record. The original annotation file has been renamed 07859.qrs-, and a realigned version of it (without its initial 14 annotations) is available as 07859.qrs. A correctly aligned, manually reviewed annotation file was also produced at that time, and is now available here as 07859.qrsc.</p>",

(A corrected version of s30801.dat was also posted together with the second half of the database.) Detailed <a href=\"notes/\">clinical notes</a> and <a href=\"trends/\">ST deviation trend plots</a> are provided for all 86 records. The entire Long-Term ST Database is also available from its original home page at the <a href=\"http://lbcsi.fri.uni-lj.si/\" target=\"other\">Laboratory for Biomedical Computer Systems and Imaging</a> at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The individual recordings of the Long-Term ST Database are between 21 and 24 hours in duration, and contain two or three ECG signals. Each ECG signal has been digitized at 250 samples per second with 12-bit resolution over a range of &plusmn;10 millivolts. Each record includes a set of meticulously verified ST episode and signal quality annotations, together with additional beat-by-beat QRS annotations and ST level measurements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For each recording, the first digit in the record name (2 or 3) indicates the number of ECG signals. Records obtained from the same subject have names that differ in the last digit only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each record is represented by 12 files, all with the same base name (the record name) and a suffix that identifies the file type:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>a (text) .hea (header) file, containing detailed clinical information for the subject;</li>\r\n\t<li>a (binary) .dat (signal) file, containing the digitized ECG signals;</li>\r\n\t<li>several (binary) annotation files, identifiable by suffix:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>.ari (automatically-generated beat annotations)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>.atr (manually corrected beat annotations)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>.16a (automatically-generated, manually-corrected ST-segment measurements, based on 16-second moving averages, updated for each beat)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>.sta (ST-segment episode annotations, Vmin = 75 &micro;V, Tmin = 30 s; see below)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>.stb (ST-segment episode annotations, Vmin = 100 &micro;V, Tmin = 30 s)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>.stc (ST-segment episode annotations, Vmin = 100 &micro;V, Tmin = 60 s)</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>a (text) .cnt file, containing counts of ST episodes in the .sta, .stb, and .stc files</li>\r\n\t<li>a (text) .stf file, containing the ST level function, the linearly approximated baseline ST level function (ST level reference function), and the ST deviation function for each ECG lead;</li>\r\n\t<li>a (binary) .tsr.zip file, containing additional data files needed by <a href=\"semia-3.0.1/\">SEMIA</a> (see below):\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>a (text) _fin.dmy file, containing fine diagnostic and morphology time series</li>\r\n\t\t<li>a (text) _raw.dmy file, containing raw diagnostic and morphology time series</li>\r\n\t\t<li>a (text) _1.sta file, containing ST segment markers</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t(Before using SEMIA, download and unzip the .tsr.zip file for the record(s) of interest into your current directory.)</li>\r\n\t<li>a (binary) .klt.zip file, which decompresses to a (text) .klt file, containing\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>time series of ST segment Karhunen-Lo&egrave;ve transform coefficients (ST segment principal components)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>time series of QRS complex Karhunen-Lo&egrave;ve transform coefficients (QRS complex principal components)</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The measurements in the .16a files were used to construct ST level and deviation functions for each signal, as recorded in the .stf files. (Further details about the .stf, tsr.zip, and .klt.zip files are available <a href=\"00README\">here</a>.) ST episodes were identified independently for each signal, based on its ST deviation function and on these criteria:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>An episode begins when the magnitude of the ST deviation function first exceeds 50 &micro;V;</li>\r\n\t<li>The deviation must reach a magnitude of Vmin or more throughout a continuous interval of at least Tmin;</li>\r\n\t<li>The episode ends when the deviation becomes smaller than 50 &micro;V, provided that it does not exceed 50 &micro;V in the following 30 seconds.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Since differing criteria may be appropriate depending on the application, three sets of ST episode annotations are provided. The annotation codes used in the .sta, .stb, .stc, and .16a files are described <a href=\"tables/acodes.png\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For each record, the numbers of ST episodes as determined by each of the three sets of criteria are summarized in an additional text file (with suffix .cnt). The deviation functions and the locations of the episodes are presented graphically in a set of trend plots <a href=\"trends/\">here</a>. Each record is represented by a 24-hour plot (_00-24.png) and by five 6-hour plots which overlap by one hour (_00-06.png, 05-11.png, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Development of the Long-Term ST Database was an inter-institutional and international effort coordinated by Prof. Franc Jager of the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. Other investigators include: Roman Dorn, PhD, and Ales Smrdel, MSc, of the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, Ljubljana; Dr. Gorazd Antolic of the University Medical Center, Ljubljana, Slovenia; Drs. Alessandro Taddei and Michele Emdin of the CNR Institute for Clinical Physiology (the creators of the <a href=\"../edb/\">European ST-T Database</a> European ST-T Database), Pisa, and Prof. Carlo Marchesi of the University of Firenze, Firenze, Italy; and Dr. Roger Mark and George Moody of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (the creators of the <a href=\"../mitdb/\">MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database</a>), Cambridge, MA, USA, and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA. The project was supported by Medtronic, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Zymed, Inc. (Camarillo, CA, USA). Development of the Long-Term ST Database began in 1995 and was completed in 2002. We thank all who contributed to this project; further details are <a href=\"thanks.shtml\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several sources contributed recordings to the Long-Term ST Database:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Eleven of the recordings included in the Long-Term ST Database are from the initial Long-Term ST Database developed under a joint U.S.-Slovenian research project between 1995 and 1998.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ten additional recordings of the Long-Term ST Database are from the collection originally gathered by the Pisa group for the European ST-T Database, which contains two-hour excerpts of some of these same recordings. The original analog recordings were redigitized for the Long-Term ST Database; since the signals have been rescaled as a result, direct comparison of the annotations in the European ST-T Database records with those for the corresponding portions of the Long-Term ST Database records is not possible. The inclusion of these recordings in the Long-Term ST Database allows study of the dynamics of ischemic ST changes over a much longer period in these previously well-studied subjects. Among the samples available here, record s20021 includes the two-hour segment that was previously digitized to produce record e0113 of the European ST-T Database.</li>\r\n\t<li>Another 18 of the LTSTDB recordings, those containing recordings with three ECG signals, were contributed to the project by Zymed, Inc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The annotation of the Long-Term ST Database was performed using <a href=\"semia-3.0.1/\">SEMIA</a>, a program written by the group in Ljubljana for this purpose. SEMIA provides an interactive graphical user interface to a semi-automated algorithm for measurement of ST levels. Sources for SEMIA, and a precompiled version for GNU/Linux, are available <a href=\"semia-3.0.1/\">here</a> (as individual files), and as a <a href=\"semia-3.0.1.tar.gz\">gzip-compressed tar archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each recording was reviewed independently by expert annotators using SEMIA at each of the three sites (Ljubljana, Pisa, and Cambridge). Participants met several times annually to obtain the consensus reference annotations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A series of SEMIA screenshots illustrates the annotation process. (Use your browser&#39;s Back button to return to this page after following the links to these screenshots in the next paragraph. If you have problems viewing the screenshots in your browser, please read <a href=\"/faq.shtml#png-problems\">this note</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first task faced by the expert annotators was to mark the locations of the PQ junction (the isoelectric level) and the J point, based on 16-second averaged cardiac cycles chosen at frequent intervals throughout the recordings. These marks serve as guideposts for the automated ST level measurement algorithm that performs the next step. The experts then examine the time series of ST level measurements in order to locate and to mark a set of <a href=\"figures/s20021_track_ST_ref_axis_shifts.png\">local reference points</a> (marked as LR in the upper panel of the figure). These are used to construct a piecewise linear baseline ST level function, which may vary over time as a result of body position changes or other factors unrelated to ischemia, especially in subjects with prior myocardial infarctions. <a href=\"figures/s20021_annotating_axis_shifts.png\">Axis shifts</a> reflect body position changes, and are usually most apparent in the QRS complexes (note the changes in the QRS principal components, KL1 - KL5, in the lower panel of the figure). By contrast, when ischemic ST changes occur, they are most apparent in the principal components of the ST segment (see the lower panel in <a href=\"figures/s20021_track_ST_ref_ischemic_episodes.png\">this screenshot</a>). Local references are placed before and after each such episode, and the episodes are annotated next. During this process, the expert annotators have the option of viewing either the <a href=\"figures/s20021_annotating_ischemic_episodes_1.png\">ST level time series</a> or the <a href=\"figures/s20021_annotating_ischemic_episodes_2.png\">ST deviation time series</a> (formed by subtracting the baseline ST level function from the uncorrected ST level time series), as shown in the upper panels of the two screenshots. For further details, see reference 4 below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/physiotools/ltstdb-doc/\">Software</a> for producing printed documentation of the Long-Term ST Database is available for Linux or Unix. The software produces compact trend plots of the ST level and ST deviation time series, with indicators of ischemic and non-ischemic ST episodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Updates</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Franc Jager and Miha Amon have contributed additional sets of time series computed from the ST segments of each normal and non-noisy beat in the database. In each case, they provided time series computed separately for each ECG lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>In 2009, Miha and Franc calculated coefficients of normalized and non-normalized Legendre orthonormal basis functions. The Legendre orthonormal-transform coefficient time series are in the <a href=\"legendre\">legendre</a> subdirectory.</li>\r\n\t<li>In 2011, Miha and Franc derived new single-lead KL basis functions for the ST segments, and used them to compute normalized and non-normalized KL coefficients. The KL calculated coefficients are centralized by their mean values. The single-lead KL coefficient time series are in the <a href=\"kl-single\">kl-single</a> subdirectory.</li>\r\n\t<li>In 2015, Miha and Franc derived another new set of single lead KL basis functions for the ST segments, and their subsequent normalized and non-normalized KL coefficients. This time, the KL coefficients are <em>not</em> mean-centered. The single-lead KL coefficient time series are in the <a href=\"kl-single-uncentralized\">kl-single-uncentralized</a> subdirectory.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Derivation of the Legendre orthonormal-transform normalized and non-normalized coefficient time series, derivation of new single-lead KL basis functions for the ST segments, and derivation of normalized and non-normalized KL coefficient time series is described in reference 5 below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kl-single and kl-single-uncentralized projects use different techniques (time domain and KL based respectively) to remove noisy heartbeats. Therefore the KL-Transform is applied on two different covariance matrices derived from two different sets of ST sections, which results in two slightly different sets of basis functions. More importantly however is that only the subsequent kl-single coefficients are centralized by their mean values.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contacts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information, please contact:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Franc Jager<br />\r\nLaboratory of Biomedical Computer Systems and Imaging<br />\r\nUniversity of Ljubljana<br />\r\nFaculty of Computer and Information Science<br />\r\nTrzaska 25<br />\r\n1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia<br />\r\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:franc.jager@fri.uni-lj.si?subject=LTSTDB%20information%20requested\">franc.jager@fri.uni-lj.si</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlessandro Taddei<br />\r\nNational Research Council (CNR)<br />\r\nInstitute of Clinical Physiology<br />\r\nVia Moruzzi 1<br />\r\n56124 Pisa, Italy<br />\r\nE-mail: taddei@ifc.cnr.it<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGeorge B.

    "full_description": "<h3>Abstract</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database of two-channel ECG recordings has been created for use in the <a href=\"/challenge/2001/\">Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2001</a>, an open competition with the goal of developing automated methods for predicting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). See the challenge <a href=\"/challenge/2001/\">announcement</a> for information about the competition, and see <a href=\"paf.shtml\">Predicting Onset of Atrial Fibrillation</a> for a brief overview of the clinical problem, its significance, and suggestions for further reading on the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The database is divided into a <em>learning set</em> (records with names of the form n<em>*</em> and p<em>*</em>) and a <em>test set</em> (records with names of the form t<em>*</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wish to download all of the files in this directory without selecting each one individually, try using a utility for batch HTTP transfers such as <a href=\"/physiotools/utilities/wget/\"> wget</a>, available here in source form for all versions of UNIX and as a precompiled binary for MS-Windows. Most Linux distributions include wget. Once you have installed wget, retrieve these files using</p>\r\n\r\n<p>wget -r -np http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/afpdb/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(or substitute the name of a nearby <a href=\"/mirrors/\">PhysioNet mirror</a> for www.physionet.org above). The files in this directory occupy about 195 megabytes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The learning set consists of 50 record sets. Each record set contains two 30-minute records with consecutive record names (e.g., p15 and p16), and two 5-minute ``continuation&#39;&#39; records with names ending in c (e.g., p15c and p16c). All four records in each record set are excerpts of longer continuous ECG recordings of a single subject; the 50 record sets come from 48 different subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The records with names beginning with p come from subjects who have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). The second (even-numbered) record in each pair of 30-minute records contains the ECG immediately preceding an episode of PAF, which can be verified by examining the like-numbered continuation record. Thus, for example, record p16 immediately precedes the episode of PAF in record p16c. The first (odd-numbered) record of the set (for example, record p15) contains 30 minutes of the ECG during a period that is distant from any episode of PAF (there is no PAF during the 45-minute period before the beginning or after the end of the 30-minute record). The corresponding 5-minute continuation record (e.g., record p15c) shows that (at least!) the minutes immediately following the ``PAF-distant&#39;&#39; record do not contain PAF. <strong>Note:</strong> Please be aware that a few of the 30-minute records in this group may contain very short bursts of PAF that escaped notice while the learning set was being compiled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The records with names beginning with n come from subjects who do not have documented atrial fibrillation, either during the period from which the records were excerpted or at any other time. The subjects include healthy controls, patients referred for long-term ambulatory ECG monitoring, and patients in intensive care units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The test set is similarly constructed of 50 record sets (from 50 different subjects); unlike the learning set, there are no continuation records. The test set records are named t01, t02, ... t100. As in the learning set, pairs of consecutively numbered records come from the same long-term ECG recording of a single subject. Approximately half of the record sets in the test set come from subjects with PAF; part 1 of the challenge is to identify these record sets, and part 2 is to identify which record in each pair immediately precedes PAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several files are associated with each record. The files with names of the form <em>*</em>.dat contain the digitized ECGs (16 bits per sample, least significant byte first in each pair, 128 samples per signal per second, samples from each channel alternating, nominally 200 A/D units per millivolt). The .hea files are (text) header files that specify the names and formats of the associated signal files; these header files are needed by the software available from this site. The .qrs files are machine-generated (binary) annotation files, provided for the convenience of those who do not wish to use their own QRS detectors. Please note that the .qrs files are unaudited and contain errors. You may wish to correct these errors (if you do, please <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org\">send your corrections to us</a>). Otherwise, you may use these annotations in uncorrected form if you wish to investigate methods of PAF prediction that are robust with respect to small numbers of QRS detection errors, or you may ignore these annotations entirely and work directly from the signal files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may wish to begin your exploration of this database using the <a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/cgi-bin/ATM?database=afpdb\">PhysioBank ATM</a>, which allows you to view any of these records using your web browser (no special software is required). <a href=\"/physiotools/\">PhysioToolkit</a> includes a large amount of free software that may be useful for studying these records further.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Special thanks to Steven Swiryn of Northwestern University, who provided many of the recordings excerpted here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Release Info</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Update (16 March 2001):</strong> Four of the records in the learning set have been replaced; these are p02, n24, n47, n48.

    "full_description": "<h3>Unconstrained and Metronomic Walking</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fractal dynamics were recently detected in the apparently &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; variations in the stride interval of human walking. Dynamical analysis of these step-to-step fluctuations revealed a self-similar pattern: fluctuations at one time scale are statistically similar to those at multiple other time scales, at least over hundreds of steps, while healthy subjects walk at their normal rate. To study the stability of this fractal property, we analyzed data obtained from ten healthy subjects who walked for 1 hour at their usual, slow and fast paces. The stride interval fluctuations exhibited long-range correlations with power-law decay for up to a thousand strides at all three walking rates. In contrast, during metronomically-paced walking, these long-range correlations disappeared; variations in the stride interval were anti-correlated. The long-range correlations observed during spontaneous walking were not affected by removal of drifts in the time series. Thus, the fractal dynamics of spontaneous stride interval are normally quite robust and intrinsic to the locomotor system. Furthermore, this fractal property of neural output may be related to the higher nervous centers responsible for control of walking rhythm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stride interval fluctuations were studied in ten young, healthy men.

    "full_description": "<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The recordings of this database are of rest tremor velocity in the index finger of 16 subjects with Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) who receive chronic high frequency electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) either uni- or bi-laterally within one of three targets:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Vim = the ventro-intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (n=3),</li>\r\n\t<li>GPi = the internal Globus pallidus (n=7), or</li>\r\n\t<li>STN = the subthalamic nucleus (n=6).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This surgical procedure involves implanting an electrode into subcortical structures (Vim, GPi or STN) for long-term stimulation at frequencies greater than 100 Hz. The mechanism by which high frequency DBS suppresses tremor and reduces other symptoms in PD is unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain, and is associated with motor symptoms including tremor (usually rest tremor, though sometimes postural tremor), bradykinesia and rigidity. In Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, tremor becomes more regular or harmonic, its frequency is shifted to a lower range (typically 4&ndash;6 Hz), its amplitude increases, the shape of its oscillations changes, and it fluctuates over time. These changes are subtle and intermittent at first, becoming more permanent and obvious as the disease progresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>g2.gif</strong> shows two seconds of Parkinsonian rest tremor velocity (metres/second) recordings from subject g2 (stimulator implanted in the GPi) under four conditions: (a) no stimulation and no medication, (b) deep brain stimulation and no medication, (c) no stimulation and 150% medication, (d) deep brain stimulation and 150% medication. Note the zoomed vertical scale in (b), (c) and (d).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chronic high frequency deep brain stimulation of the Vim can decrease tremor amplitude in a spectacular way. Deep brain stimulation of the GPi and STN have been shown to relieve not only tremor but also other symptoms of PD such as rigidity and dyskinesia. See<strong> g2.gif</strong> for an example of the effect of deep brain stimulation of the GPi on tremor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The raw data were obtained using a low intensity velocity-transducing laser that was directed at a piece of reflective paper on the subject&rsquo;s index finger tip, with the output voltage proportional to the velocity of the finger. See <strong>vlaser.gif</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>DBS/Medication Conditions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tremor was recorded for approximately 60 seconds under various conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>two conditions of DBS (on-off) and two conditions of medication (L-dopa on-off)<br />\r\n\t[total: 55 recordings of approx 60 seconds each]</li>\r\n\t<li>every 15 minutes when DBS was stopped for 60 minutes (medication off)<br />\r\n\t[total: 46 recordings of approx 60 seconds each]</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that not all subjects were tested under all conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the &quot;medication off&quot; condition, the subject did not take any medication for at least 12 hours.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Massachusetts General Hospital/Marquette Foundation (MGH/MF) Waveform Database is a comprehensive collection of electronic recordings of hemodynamic and electrocardiographic waveforms of stable and unstable patients in critical care units, operating rooms, and cardiac catheterization laboratories. It is the result of a collaboration between physicians, biomedical engineers and nurses at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The database consists of recordings from 250 patients and represents a broad spectrum of physiologic and pathophysiologic states. Individual recordings vary in length from 12 to 86 minutes, and in most cases are about an hour long.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"patient-guide.shtml\"><strong>Patient Guide</strong></a> provides additional information for each recording, including (as available) age, sex, diagnoses, pertinent medical history, ECG interpretation, ventilation, a timeline of events that occurred during the recording, and additional clinical observations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The typical recording includes three ECG leads, arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, central venous pressure, respiratory impedance, and airway CO2 waveforms. Some recordings include intra-cranial, left atrial, ventricular and/or intra-aortic-balloon pressure waveforms. ECG calibration, pressure zero, pressure calibration, and pressure/catheter frequency response tests are also recorded. Relevant clinical data and events are documented for each file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original signals were recorded on 8-channel instrumentation tape and then digitized at twice real time using <a href=\"/physiotools/old/dbag/sample-1.htm\">sample(1)</a>. The raw sampling rate of 1440 samples per second per signal was reduced by a factor of two to yield an effective rate of 360 samples per second per signal relative to real time. This approach permitted the use of low-order analog antialiasing in combination with high-order digital FIR antialiasing to minimize phase distortion in the digitized signals (see <a href=\"sample8.hea\">sample8.hea</a> for the FIR coefficients).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each record includes an annotation (.ari) file, which contains beat and event labels. The annotation files have been made available in their present form to aid users of the database in locating interesting features of the recordings. The current annotation files, although they have been prepared with care and substantial effort, are likely to contain a small number of errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MGH/MF Waveform Database was originally distributed in unannotated form on instrumentation tape, and later in annotated digital form on a set of 10 CD-ROMs. The CD-ROMs included the software and documentation in the <a href=\"cape/\">cape</a> directory, relating to CAPE (Computer Aided Patient Emulator), a system designed by the creators of the database to permit real-time analog playback of the signals from a PC. A software-only demonstration version of CAPE is included; the full version of CAPE, including an ISA-bus PC card and additional software, may be available from <a href=\"http://www.cardionics.com/\" target=\"other\">Cardionics, Inc.</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original CD-ROMs contained three additional directories that are not included here. The bin and lib directories of the CD-ROMs contained early versions of several of the <a href=\"/physiotools/wag/\">WFDB applications</a> and of the <a href=\"/physiotools/wpg/\">WFDB library</a>, precompiled for MS-DOS. Current versions of this software (provided <a href=\"/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">here</a>) run on a wide variety of modern operating systems and have been improved in numerous ways, and are also provided in source form for study, customization, or further development. The mitdb directory of the CD-ROMs contained a brief excerpt of record 100 from the <a href=\"/physiobank/database/mitdb/\">MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database</a>; this excerpt is now available as record 100s in the <a href=\"/physiotools/wfdb/data/\">data</a> directory of the WFDB Software Package.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We thank Jeffrey Cooper and Penny Ford-Carleton of the Massachusetts General Hospital for arranging for these recordings to be made available via PhysioNet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Updates</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The files mgh026.hea, mgh175.hea, mgh196.hea, mgh199.hea, and mgh210.hea were corrected on 3 January 2017 so that the signal lengths stated in the header files match the size of their corresponding dat files.

Applications using WFDB library version 10.4.5 or later can read EDF files directly with no conversion required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recordings were obtained from Caucasian males and females (21&ndash;35 years old) without any medication; they contain horizontal EOG, FpzCz and PzOz EEG, each sampled at 100 Hz. The sc* recordings also contain the submental-EMG envelope, oro-nasal airflow, rectal body temperature and an event marker, all sampled at 1 Hz. The st* recordings contain submental EMG sampled at 100 Hz and an event marker sampled at 1 Hz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sc*.rec recordings contain the envelope of the EMG signal, at a 1Hz sampling frequency. The dimension of this envelope signal, &quot;uV-mrs&quot;, means &quot;microvolt mean-root-squared&quot;, in which &#39;mrs&#39; is related to, but not synonymous with, the well-known abbreviation &#39;rms&#39; (root-mean-square). In both rms and mrs, the letters, r, m, and s mean &#39;root&#39;, &#39;mean&#39;, and &#39;square&#39;, respectively. The order of these components differs between rms and mrs, however, making them essentially different variables. In this case, the electrical EMG signal is expressed in microvolts (uV), then rectified (root-squared: rs) and then smoothed (mean: m) over the 1-second time-intervals between two successive samples. So it is the mean (m) of the root-squared (rs) signal: mrs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The st*.rec recordings came from body-worn bio-signal amplifiers that transmitted those signals digitally to a PC. All transmitters had the same FM radio frequency. So, when two patients were recorded next to each other the FM receivers might mix up those patients. That risk was very small due to the location of transmitter and receiver, but in order to be sure each transmitter had a different baseline of the ID+Sync+Error signal. For instance the st7132j0.rec and st7052j0.rec recordings were made by transmitters numbers 1 and 2, respectively, hence the baseline of the signal is 1 and 2, respectively in those two recordings. The transmitter also had a marker (M) button: pressing the button added 32 to the &#39;ID+Sync+Error&#39; signal. The system also continuously monitored the quality of the received (digital) signal: any error subtracted 32 from the signal. So, the dimension &quot;ID+M-E&quot; indicates that the baseline of the signal identifies (ID) the transmitter, shows the marker button as a positive deflection (+M) and any error in the telemetry link as a negative deflection (-E). Nice examples are in all ST recordings because the telemetry link in this project was optical and it was disconnected between the hook-up in the afternoon and the start of the trial late in the evening. At the start (at 00:31:17 in st7132j0.rec and 23:23:15hr in st7052j0.rec) the ID+Sync+Error signal switches from negative (error: no connection) to 1 or 2 (ID of the transmitter), and a few seconds later the patient or nurse pressed the marker button which shows as a short (1 second) positive peak. In this project the baseline level proves that in the evening each patient was reconnected to the same file that he was hooked-up on in the afternoon. This is particularly important because the afternoon session included the creation of the patient-ID in the EDF header.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hypnograms are manually scored according to Rechtschaffen &amp; Kales based on Fpz-Cz / Pz-Oz EEG instead of C4-A1 / C3-A2 EEG: see</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B van Sweden, B Kemp, HAC Kamphuisen, EA van der Velde.

    "full_description": "<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The files in this set can be used for testing a variety of devices that monitor the electrocardiogram. The recordings include both synthetic and real waveforms. For details on these test waveforms and how to use them, please refer to section 5.1.2.1, paragraphs (e) and (g) in the reference below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each recording contains one ECG signal sampled at 720 Hz with 12-bit resolution. The recordings can be viewed or converted to text form using the <a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/cgi-bin/ATM?database=aami-ec13\">PhysioBank ATM</a>, or read directly using the <a href=\"/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB Software Package</a>. The record names refer to the illustrations in the reference below (figures 3 and 4 on pages 25 and 26 of that document). Note that EC13 specifies that the tachycardia waveforms in figure 4 should be presented following an abrupt transition from synthetic waveforms specified in figure 6 of EC13; thus the aami4* records each begin with 30 seconds of triangle waveforms, followed by the figure 4 waveforms. The records named aami4a_d and aami4a_h, etc., contain the half-size and double-size versions of the figure 4 data that are mentioned in the standard. (The names are misleading, since the _d records contain the half-size versions, and the _h records contain the double-size versions, the opposite of what the record names imply. The names are those given by AAMI, the source of these files, and they have not been changed, in hopes of avoiding further confusion. Thanks to Humberto Valdes for pointing out this issue.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to these waveforms, EC13 specifies the use of specific synthesized waveforms that can be created using the <a href=\"/physiotools/matlab/ECGwaveGen/\">ECG waveform generator for Matlab/Octave</a> available in PhysioToolkit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardiac monitors, heart rate meters, and alarms [American National Standard (ANSI/AAMI EC13:2002)].

To avoid this problem, one needs first to integrate the original anti-correlated signal and then apply the DFA method. The correct scaling exponent can thus be obtained from the relation between <em>n</em> [the DFA box length] and <em>F(n)/n</em> instead of <em>F(n)</em> ... In order to provide a more accurate estimate of <em>F(n)</em>, the largest box size <em>n</em> we use is <em>Nmax/10</em>, where <em>Nmax</em> is the total number of points in the signal.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Since these files are quite large, they are provided as gzip-compressed text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

The first portions of the AHA Database were released in 1982, and it was completed in 1985. No revisions or updates were made subsequently, although ECRI has distributed the database in several different formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until about 2003, the only available portion of the AHA database consisted of 80 two-channel excerpts of analog ambulatory ECG recordings, digitized at 250 Hz per channel with 12-bit resolution over a 10 mV range. These 80 recordings, designated as the <em>development set</em> or <em>series 1</em>, are divided into eight <em>classes</em> of ten recordings each, according to the highest level of ventricular ectopy present:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>no ventricular ectopy (records 1001 through 1010)</li>\r\n\t<li>isolated unifocal PVCs (records 2001 through 2010)</li>\r\n\t<li>isolated multifocal PVCs (records 3001 through 3010)</li>\r\n\t<li>ventricular bi- and trigeminy (records 4001 through 4010)</li>\r\n\t<li>R-on-T PVCs (records 5001 through 5010)</li>\r\n\t<li>ventricular couplets (records 6001 through 6010)</li>\r\n\t<li>ventricular tachycardia (records 7001 through 7010)</li>\r\n\t<li>ventricular flutter/fibrillation (records 8001 through 8010)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The final thirty minutes of each recording are annotated beat-by-beat, although supraventricular ectopic beats are not distinguished from normal sinus beats. Two versions of the database are available: the <em>short</em> version includes five minutes of unannotated ECG signals prior to the thirty-minute annotated segment of each recording, and the <em>long</em> version includes 2.5 hours of unannotated ECG signals prior to each annotated segment. The names of the short-version records are the same as the corresponding long-version records, except that the second digit is 2 (thus record 4207 is the short version of record 4007, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time the AHA Database was created, a second set of 75 recordings (designated as the <em>test set</em> or <em>series 2</em>) was constructed according to the same criteria as the development set. (Only 5 recordings in the R-on-T PVC class were included in the test set). The test set was intended for evaluations without any possibility that the detectors might have been tuned (optimized) for the test data; for this reason, the test set was unavailable until about 2003. The names of the records in the test set are similar to those in the development set; the first digit indicates the class, and the second digit is 1 (for the long version) or 3 (for the short version). For example, the test set&#39;s record 6102 is a long-version record containing ventricular couplets (class 6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both sets of the AHA Database are now available on CDs or DVDs from ECRI (address above).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Sample Excluded Record</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The files available here are not part of the AHA Database.</strong> The 0001.* and 0201.* files have been derived from a sample given to us in 1980 by the creators of the AHA Database. The original recording had been a candidate for inclusion in the database and was digitized and annotated using the same methods used for the AHA Database records. After the annotation process was complete, the recording was excluded from the AHA Database since it was found to contain ectopy of a higher grade than the class for which it had been chosen as a candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the records in the AHA Database, the data consist of a 3-hour recording of two ECG signals, for which the last 30 minutes are annotated beat-by-beat. From the original data, we have prepared record 0001, containing the entire 3-hour recording, and record 0201, containing the last 35 minutes only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB Software Package</a> includes a set of <a href=\"/physiotools/wag/a2m-1.htm\">converters</a> that can translate between the formats used for the AHA database and the standard formats used for PhysioBank databases. These converters were used to prepare the 0001.* and 0201.* files in this directory. If you use these converters to prepare a set of AHA Database files in PhysioBank format, you can check that your files are correct by comparing their checksums with those given in the MD5*, SHA1*, and/or SHA256* files below. These have been verified using copies of the AHA Database 9-track tapes, floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs.</p>",

The &quot;parent&quot; cohorts include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>the Framingham Offspring Cohort</li>\r\n\t<li>the Hagerstown and Minneapolis/St. Paul sites of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study</li>\r\n\t<li>the Hagerstown, Sacramento and Pittsburgh sites of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)</li>\r\n\t<li>the Strong Heart Study sites in South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Arizona</li>\r\n\t<li>studies of respiratory disease in Tucson and of hypertension in New York</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>From these parent cohorts, a sample of participants who met the inclusion criteria (age 40 years or older; no history of treatment of sleep apnea; no tracheostomy; no current home oxygen therapy) was invited to participate in the baseline examination of the SHHS, which included an initial polysomnogram (SHHS-1). Several cohorts over-sampled snorers in order to increase the study-wide prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. In all, 6441 individuals were enrolled between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1998. During exam cycle 3 (January 2001- June 2003), a second polysomnogram (SHHS-2) was obtained in 3295 of the participants. Full details of the study design and cohort are found in [<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#ref2\">2</a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Polysomnograms were obtained in an unattended setting, usually in the homes of the participants, by trained and certified technicians.

Physiologic signals from overnight sleep studies are available as downloadable EDF PSGs. Users can also download standard (Rechtschaffen and Kales or AASM) annotations of these PSGs, and summary measures derived from them. The first data set available includes over 8,000 studies from exams 1 and 2 from the Sleep Heart Health Study, with scheduled new data releases every quarter from additional data sets. NSRR also provides open-source software for viewing and analyzing these data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Quan, S.F., et al., The Sleep Heart Health Study: design, rationale, and methods.

    "full_description": "<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database of two-channel ECG recordings has been created for use in the <a href=\"/challenge/2004/\">Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2004</a>, an open competition with the goal of developing automated methods for predicting spontaneous termination of atrial fibrillation (AF). See the challenge <a href=\"/challenge/2004/\">announcement</a> for information about the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The database is divided into a <em>learning set</em> (records with names of the form n<em>*</em>, s<em>*</em>, and t<em>*</em>) and two <em>test sets</em> (records with names of the form a<em>*</em> and b<em>*</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wish to download all of the files in this directory without selecting each one individually, try using a utility for batch HTTP transfers such as <a href=\"/physiotools/utilities/wget/\"> wget</a>, available here in source form for all versions of UNIX and as a precompiled binary for MS-Windows. Most Linux distributions include wget. Once you have installed wget, retrieve these files using</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-bash\">wget -r -np http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/aftdb/</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>(or substitute the name of a nearby <a href=\"/mirrors/\">PhysioNet mirror</a> for www.physionet.org above). The files in this database occupy about 3.3 megabytes in all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each record is a one-minute segment of atrial fibrillation, containing two ECG signals, each sampled at 128 samples per second. The segments were extracted from long-term (20-24 hour) ECG recordings. Each record includes a set of QRS annotations produced by an automated detector, in which all detected beats, including any ectopic beats, are labelled as normal. These annotations have not been audited and may contain a small number of errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"learning-set/\">learning set</a> contains 30 records in all, with 10 records in each of three groups:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Group N</strong> (records n01, n02, ... n10): non-terminating AF (defined as AF that was not observed to have terminated for the duration of the long-term recording, at least an hour following the segment).</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Group S</strong> (records s01, s02, ... s10) AF that terminates one minute after the end of the record.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Group T</strong> (records t01, t02, ... t10) AF that terminates immediately (within one second) after the end of the record. Note that these records come from the same long-term ECG recordings as those in group S and immediately follow the Group S records (for example, t01 is the continuation of s01).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The learning set records were obtained from 20 different subjects (10 group N, 10 group S/T).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"test-set-a/\">Test set A</a> contains 30 records (a01, a02, ... a30) from 30 subjects (none represented in the learning set or in test set B). Approximately half of these records belong to group N, and the others belong to group T. The goal of the first challenge event is to identify which records in test set A belong to group T.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"test-set-b/\">Test set B</a> contains 20 records (b01, b02, ... b20), 2 from each of 10 subjects (none represented in the learning set or in test set A). One record of each pair belongs to group S, and the other to group T; note, however, that there are short gaps (of less than one second) between some of these pairs. The goal of the second challenge event is to identify which records belong to group T.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several files are associated with each record. The files with names of the form <em>*</em>.dat contain the digitized ECGs (16 bits per sample, least significant byte first in each pair, 128 samples per signal per second, samples from each channel alternating, nominally 200 A/D units per millivolt). The .hea files are (text) header files that specify the names and formats of the associated signal files; these header files are needed by the software available from this site. The .qrs files are machine-generated (binary) annotation files, provided for the convenience of those who do not wish to use their own QRS detectors. Please note that the .qrs files are unaudited and contain errors. You may wish to correct these errors (if you do, please <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org\">send your corrections to us</a>). Otherwise, you may use these annotations in uncorrected form if you wish to investigate methods of predicting AF terminationthat are robust with respect to small numbers of QRS detection errors, or you may ignore these annotations entirely and work directly from the signal files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may wish to begin your exploration of this database using the <a href=\"http://www.physionet.org/cgi-bin/chart?database=aftdb\">Chart-O-Matic</a>, which allows you to view any of these records using your web browser (no special software is required). <a href=\"/physiotools/\">PhysioToolkit</a> includes a large amount of free software that may be useful for studying these records further.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Special thanks to Steven Swiryn of Northwestern University, who provided the recordings excerpted here.</p>",

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00000526\" target=\"other\"> Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST)</a> was a landmark NHLBI-sponsored study designed to test the hypothesis that the suppression of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular premature complexes (PVCs) in survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) would decrease the number of deaths from ventricular arrhythmias and improve survival. Enrollment required an acute MI within the preceding 2 years and 6 or more PVCs per hour during a pre-treatment (qualifying) long-term ECG (Holter) recording. Those subjects enrolled within 90 days of the index MI were required to have left ventricular ejection fractions less than or equal to 55%, while those enrolled after this 90 day window were required to have an ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%. CAST enrolled 3,549 patients in all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After initial qualification, patients in CAST were randomly assigned to receive encainide, flecainide, moricizine (antiarrhythmic drugs) or a placebo. Patients who had significant suppression of PVCs with a particular agent were then continued on that agent or on placebo. In April of 1989, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended that the encainide and flecainide arms of the study be discontinued because of excessive mortality in the drug arms of the trial primarily due to arrhythmia, acute MI with shock, or chronic congestive heart failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAST was then followed by CAST-II, which involved continuation of the moricizine arm of the CAST and placebo. CAST-II was divided into two blinded, randomized phases: an early, 14-day exposure phase that evaluated the risk of starting treatment with moricizine after MI and a long-term phase that evaluated the effect of moricizine on survival after MI in patients whose PVCs were either adequately suppressed by moricizine or only partially suppressed. CAST-II was stopped early because long-term treatment with moricizine after an MI was associated with a trend to excess mortality as compared with no treatment or placebo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CAST-II study authors concluded that as with the other antiarrhythmic agents used in CAST (flecainide and encainide), the use of moricizine to suppress asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular premature complexes after MI was not only ineffective but also harmful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to investigate further the relationship between survival and changes in heart rate variability in response to anti-arrhythmic treatment, Phyllis K. Stein, Ph.D., of Washington University, St. Louis, obtained pre-treatment (qualifying) and on-therapy (suppression) long-term ECG recordings from participants in CAST (including CAST II) from the CAST data coordinating center. She selected for study a subset of the CAST patients, consisting of those who</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>had usable pre-treatment and on-therapy recordings, based on data collected during the original CAST and CAST II studies</li>\r\n\t<li>received a randomly-assigned antiarrhythmic treatment that successfully reduced their PVC rates by at least 80% on the first attempt, and</li>\r\n\t<li>continued on that treatment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These criteria were satisfied by 734 patients, of whom 69 died during the study period. The CAST RR Interval Sub-Study Database consists of RR interval time series from the pre-treatment and on-therapy recordings from these patients. The database also includes data from 75 additional subjects for whom only one acceptable recording was available but who satisfied the other selection criteria. A small number of subjects included in this database were excluded from Dr. Stein&rsquo;s study because of the occurrence of atrial fibrillation or paced rhythm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All recordings were scanned by an experienced research arrhythmia analyst, using standard Holter analysis procedures. Beat annotation files were edited in a second pass to identify improperly measured RR intervals to be excluded from further analysis. A limited amount of additional information has been recorded in a header (.hea) file for each record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This database has several important limitations:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Sixty percent of the tapes were recorded on reel-to-reel recorders or other recorders that lacked a calibrated timing signal. Such recordings are likely to contain frequency-domain artifacts, the result of variations in the speed of tape recording or playback (wow and flutter), which, if unrecognized, can confound analysis of heart rate variability. The header (.hea) file for each record indicates if a calibrated timing signal was recorded.</li>\r\n\t<li>The purpose of the analysis was to identify N-N intervals accurately. Manually inserted beats were always labeled as Q (unclassified). Great effort was made to identify beats with mismeasured onset points; these beats were also labeled as Q.</li>\r\n\t<li>Attention was given primarily to N-N intervals of durations that fall between limits indicated in the .hea file for each record. Little effort was made to correct N-N intervals with unusually short or long durations; beats following such intervals were labeled as Q. Therefore, although beats identified as V or A are almost certainly premature ventricular or supraventricular beats, respectively, their incidences are probably underestimated.</li>\r\n\t<li>The original ECG signals are not available. Accordingly, it is not possible to verify the recorded intervals, to identify or correct errors in beat labels or location, or to study features of the ECG other than inter-beat intervals.</li>\r\n\t<li>The RR interval time series contain small numbers of anomalously long intervals that typically result from errors in beat detection during the standard Holter analysis. For example, if a single beat is missed, an interval that is about twice as long as the correct intervals appears in the RR interval time series. These long intervals appear as noise in the RR interval time series. It is possible that rare sinus pauses may also account for a few of these long intervals, but this cannot be verified since the original ECG signals are unavailable.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This significant collection of time series, comprising in aggregate about 150 million RR intervals, has been contributed to PhysioNet by Dr. Stein, with the consent of the NHLBI. Limited access to additional data from the original CAST and CAST II studies is available to qualified investigators on application to the NHLBI; see the <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/deca/descriptions/cast.htm\" target=\"other\">CAST page</a> on the NHLBI&rsquo;s web site.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Description of the Database</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The database is divided into three groups of records (<a href=\"e/\">e</a>, <a href=\"f/\">f</a>, and <a href=\"m/\">m</a>), corresponding to the three medications that the subjects received. Within each group, the data from a single subject are represented by a pair of records (baseline and on-therapy; note that the database includes a few subjects that are represented by only one record each).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Record names are of the form <em>dnnnx</em>. The first character, <em>d</em>, indicates which of the three medications under study was to be given to the subject:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"e/\">e</a>: Encainide</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"f/\">f</a>: Flecainide</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"m/\">m</a>: Moricizine</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The medication code is followed by a three-digit number, <em>nnn</em>. These first four characters of the record name, <em>dnnn</em>, form the subject identifier. The final character of the record name indicates if the subject was receiving the study medication:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>a: baseline (pre-treatment; no medication)</li>\r\n\t<li>b: on-therapy (during medication)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, for example, record f004b is from a subject receiving Flecainide, and the corresponding baseline data for the same subject is in record f004a.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The .atr files are <a href=\"/faq.shtml#annot-read\"><em>annotation files</em></a> that contain a label for each QRS complex, indicating its type and time of occurrence. The RR interval time series can be obtained by reading these files using software such as <a href=\"/physiotools/wag/ann2rr-1.htm\">ann2rr</a>; see the <a href=\"/tutorials/hrv/\">RR Intervals, Heart Rate, and HRV Howto</a> for further information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The .hea files contain additional information about the recordings that may be of interest, including the subject&rsquo;s age range (in 5-year quantiles) and gender, a note about the type of recording (indicating if it is flutter-compensated), the time of day at which the recording began, and a recording date. Note that for purposes of deidentification, the true recording date is not provided. For each subject, a randomly chosen offset has been applied to the baseline and on-therapy record dates (the same offset is applied to both dates, so that the interval between the recordings is correct). The fictitious recording dates given are close enough to the true dates that it should still be possible to study, for example, seasonal variations of variables of interest in this database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A list in plain text form of the names of the 1543 records in this database can be found in the <a href=\"RECORDS\">RECORDS</a> file.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Links to datasets</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"e/index.shtml\">Dataset e for subjects who were randomly assigned to receive Encainide </a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"f/index.shtml\">Dataset f for subjects who were randomly assigned to receive Flecainide </a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"m/index.shtml\">Dataset m for subjects who were randomly assigned to receive Moricizine</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Selected references</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Epstein AE, Bigger JT Jr, Wyse DG, Romhilt DW, Reynolds-Haertle RA, Hallstrom AP.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An estimated 400,000 Americans, and millions more worldwide, die suddenly each year. These events are most often initiated with a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, including ventricular tachycardia (monomorphic or polymorphic), ventricular flutter, or ventricular fibrillation, with a smaller percentage related to a primary bradyarrhythmia. Sudden cardiac death syndrome may be due to a wide variety of different electrical and mechanical substrates, including acute myocardial infarction, chronic coronary disease with prior myocardial infarction(s), cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, valvular heart disease, right ventricular dysplasia, the long Q-T syndrome (acquired or congenital), Wolff-Parkinson-White pre-excitation, the Brugada syndrome, drug toxicity (e.g., proarrhythmic effects of cardioactive drugs; epinephrine, cocaine, and related stimulants), and so forth. Moreover, some individuals have no demonstrable electrical or mechanical predisposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>PhysioNet has inaugurated a Sudden Cardiac Death Database to support research and to stimulate progress in this important area of electrophysiology.

Because of the retrospective nature of this collection, there are important limitations. Patient information is limited, and sometimes completely unavailable, including data regarding drug regimens and drug dosages. Further, these cases may not be representative of spontaneous episodes of sudden death in what is likely a very heterogenous group of subjects. Despite these shortcomings, these unique recordings may provide important clues to the pathogenesis of sudden death syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a small collection of an important type of data. The task of annotating this database is particularly difficult because of the complexity of the included cardiac rhythms. We invite the community to help us make this collection larger, more representative, and more useful, and to annotate it more thoroughly and rigorously. We welcome contributions of additional data from other investigators who have access to similar records. We also invite interested researchers to review and revise the annotation files provided for these recordings; if you are interested in participating in this effort, please <a href=\"mailto:webmaster@physionet.org?subject=SDDB Annotator\r\nInquiry\">write</a> for additional information.

Each subject is represented by one to five records. There are no subjects numbered 124, 132, 134, or 161. Each record includes 15 simultaneously measured signals: the conventional 12 leads (i, ii, iii, avr, avl, avf, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6) together with the 3 Frank lead ECGs (vx, vy, vz). Each signal is digitized at 1000 samples per second, with 16 bit resolution over a range of &plusmn; 16.384 mV. On special request to the contributors of the database, recordings may be available at sampling rates up to 10 KHz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the header (.hea) file of most of these ECG records is a detailed clinical summary, including age, gender, diagnosis, and where applicable, data on medical history, medication and interventions, coronary artery pathology, ventriculography, echocardiography, and hemodynamics.

    "full_description": "<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database contains postural sway measurements for 15 healthy young (mean age 23, standard deviation 2), and 12 healthy elderly (mean age 73, standard deviation 3) volunteers. Each subject&#39;s postural sway was recorded during a test of 10 minutes for the young subjects, or 5 minutes for the elderly subjects, in all cases with a 2-minute seated break midway through the test. Each test was divided into 30-second trials, and each file of the database contains data for one of these 30-second trials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In each shoe, subjects wore a gel-based insole, which included vibrating elements (tactors) beneath the forefoot and heel. The vibrations were generated using a digitized uniform white noise signal, low-pass filtered with 100 Hz cutoff. Before beginning the test, each subject adjusted the amplitude of the vibrations produced by the tactors to a level that could be felt only slightly. The stimulation level was then reduced by 10% so that the vibrations were subsensory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data from the young and elderly subjects are contained within the <a href=\"yng/\">yng</a> and <a href=\"eh/\">eh</a> (elderly healthy) directories respectively. Within these, separate directories for each subject contain the data for that subject. For each subject, subsensory vibration was applied during half of the 30-second trials (those recorded in the database files within the STIM subdirectories of the subject directories), and no stimulus was applied during the remaining (control) trials (those in the NULL subdirectories). The sequence of noise and control trials was randomized in a pairwise fashion, so that subjects were not aware of the presence or absence of the stimulus in any given trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example should make this arrangement clear. Within the <a href=\"eh/\">eh</a> directory are subdirectories for each of the 12 healthy elderly volunteers, designated as <a href=\"eh/MT1502/\">MT1502</a>, <a href=\"eh/MT1503/\">MT1503</a>, etc. Within the directory for the first of these, MT1502, are subdirectories <a href=\"eh/MT1502/NULL/\">NULL</a> and <a href=\"eh/MT1502/STIM/\">STIM</a>, containing control and noise trial data for subject MT1502. Within each of these are the data files, with names that indicate their positions within the sequence of trials for that subject. For example, the data for the first trial, <a href=\"eh/MT1502/NULL/fMT150201.txt\">fMT150201.txt</a>, are found in the <a href=\"eh/MT1502/NULL/\">NULL</a> subdirectory, so this indicates that subject MT1502&#39;s first trial was a control trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data files are two-column text files, and the data are measurements of the displacement of a reflective marker placed on the subject&#39;s shoulder to characterize whole body postural sway. A Vicon motion analysis system was used to record the mediolateral (side-to-side) and anteroposterior (front-to-back) displacement (normalized by the height of the marker) in columns 1 and 2 respectively, at a rate of 60 samples per second, throughout each 30 second trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data may be downloaded as individual files, from the <a href=\"eh/\">eh</a> and <a href=\"yng/\">yng</a> directories, or as a gzip-compressed tar archive of the entire data set (<a href=\"nesfdb.tar.gz\">nesfdb.tar.gz</a>, 6.5 Mb).</p>",

    "full_description": "<h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1975, our laboratories at Boston&#39;s Beth Israel Hospital (now the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) and at MIT have supported our own research into arrhythmia analysis and related subjects. One of the first major products of that effort was the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which we completed and began distributing in 1980. The database was the first generally available set of standard test material for evaluation of arrhythmia detectors, and has been used for that purpose as well as for basic research into cardiac dynamics at more than 500 sites worldwide. Originally, we distributed the database on 9-track half-inch digital tape at 800 and 1600 bpi, and on quarter-inch IRIG-format FM analog tape. In August, 1989, we produced a CD-ROM version of the database.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database contains 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings, obtained from 47 subjects studied by the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory between 1975 and 1979.

    "full_description": "<h3>Abstract</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database includes 35 eight-minute ECG recordings of human subjects who experienced episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular flutter, and ventricular fibrillation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Record cu01 was obtained from a long-term ECG (Holter) recording (played back at real time for digitization); the other records were digitized in real time from high-level (1 V/mV nominal) analog signals from patient monitors. All signals were passed through an active second-order Bessel low-pass filter with a cutoff of 70 Hz, and were digitized at 250 Hz with 12-bit resolution over a 10 V range (10 mV nominal relative to the unamplified signals). Each record contains 127,232 samples (slightly less than 8.5 minutes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In episodes of cardiac failure, fibrillation is almost always preceded by a run of ventricular tachycardia, which eventually gives way to the fibrillation itself. The onset of fibrillation is extremely difficult to pinpoint in many cases. Any clinically useful detector should respond to the runs of tachycardia preceding fibrillation, since medical intervention is needed at the earliest opportunity. Thus any detector responding to the premonitory tachycardia can exhibit a negative &ldquo;time to alarm&rdquo; compared to the onset of fibrillation as recorded in the reference annotation files. For this reason, the database is defined as a tachyarrhythmia database rather than a fibrillation database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In these records, the minimum number of non-VF beats prior to the onset of a VF episode is 61. The mean time interval from the beginning of the record to the onset of VF is 5:47 (with a standard deviation of 2:01). Five records (cu12, cu15, cu24, cu25, and cu32) were from paced patients (in some cases, pacing artifacts are not visible, and pacing is apparent only from the regularity of the rhythm). Repeated defibrillation attempts are visible in many records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recordings were originally collected by Floyd M. Nolle at the Creighton University Cardiac Center. High-quality recordings of these rhythms are extremely rare, and of great importance both for development and evaluation of VF detectors and for basic research on the dynamics of VF. We wish to thank Richard W. Bowser, formerly of the Creighton University Cardiac Center, for preserving these recordings, for making them available for distribution in this format, and for preparing the preceding notes on this database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reference annotation files supplied for this database have been included to aid users in locating events of interest. They are in no sense definitive. All beats are labelled normal (although many are ectopic). VF onset annotations mark only the approximate beginnings of VF episodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reference annotation files for records cu01, cu03, and cu12 were updated in January 2006 to include previously missing ventricular fibrillation onset and end annotations (thanks to Janusz Irzyk for reporting these missing). The previous versions of these three files remain available here for comparison (cu01.atr-, cu03.atr-, and cu12.atr-).</p>",

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database contains 135 pairs of RR interval time series, recorded by implanted cardioverter defibrillators (Medtronic Jewel PlusTM ICD 7218) in 78 subjects. Each series contains between 986 and 1022 RR intervals. One series of each pair includes a spontaneous episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), and the other is a sample of the intrinsic (usually sinus) rhythm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICD continuously digitizes and analyzes the patient&#39;s electrogram (EGM). Four EGM signals are digitized:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>HVA - HVB (Can - Coil)</li>\r\n\t<li>P-/S-P+/S (Tip - Ring)</li>\r\n\t<li>HVA-P+/S (Can - Ring)</li>\r\n\t<li>P-/S - HVB (Tip - Coil)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>R-waves are detected in the EGM with an auto-adjusting sense amplifier. The automatic threshold adjustment can affect measured cycle lengths if the sensed R wave crosses the decaying threshold at different levels. RR interval measurements are always based on the P-/S-P+/S (Tip-Ring) EGM. Each interval is classified depending on the programmed tachycardia and fibrillation detection intervals (TDI and FDI, respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICD maintains a buffer containing the 1024 most recently measured RR intervals. When a tachyarrhythmia is detected, the ICD delivers programmed pacing, cardioversion, or defibrillation therapy and records a snapshot of the RR interval buffer, thus capturing the sequence of 1024 RR intervals that immediately precede the detected event (ending at the time when the ICD first detected the event, not at the termination of the event). The stored intervals are truncated (not rounded) to a multiple of 10 ms (e.g., an interval of 457 ms is recorded in the snapshot as 450 ms). The most recent snapshot is stored in the ICD&#39;s memory until the patient returns for a checkup, at which time the ICD is interrogated using a Medtronic 9790 ICD programmer, the stored snapshot is downloaded, and the ICD may be reprogrammed as appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the stored snapshot of the most recently detected event, a snapshot of the RR interval buffer is also obtained when the ICD is interrogated; such snapshots thus contain the most recent RR intervals, which can be used as baseline (control) data to compare with the detected events. Varying numbers of the least recent intervals in these snapshots are lost during device interrogation, so these baseline sequences contain between 986 and 1022 intervals each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The snapshots downloaded from the ICDs also include a few seconds of the high-resolution EGM, as illustrated below; EGM segments are not available for the records in this database, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each RR interval sequence included in this database has a three-part file name of the form <em>ssss.ttn</em>, where <em>ssss</em> is a four-digit patient number, <em>tt</em> is either <strong>vf</strong>, <strong>vt</strong>, or <strong>mr</strong>, and <em>n</em> is a sequence number for each type of event. The files as provided by Medtronic can be found in the <a href=\"RRdata1/\">RRdata1</a> and <a href=\"mr\">mr</a> directories. They are in plain text format, and each contains a column of numbers, which are the RR intervals in milliseconds. In addition, a set of PhysioBank-compatible annotation and header files has been created from the text files; these are in the <a href=\"data/\">data</a> directory. These have record names of the form <em>ssss_ttn</em>, where the components are as described above.</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"margin:1em auto; width:90%\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>vf</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>intervals prior to detection of spontaneous VF</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>vt</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>intervals prior to detection of spontaneous VT</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>mr</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>intervals prior to ICD interrogation (&quot;mr&quot; = &quot;most recent&quot;)</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Each <strong>vf</strong> and <strong>vt</strong> sequence has a matching <strong>mr</strong> (baseline) sequence designated by the same numerals in the sequence names.

Five morphologic characteristics (shape, components crossing the baseline, initial slope, largest component, and notching) were used to classify the detected episodes; if any of these differed between the detected episode&#39;s EGM and the paired SR EGM, the episode was classified as a VT or VF. If the two EGMs were similar in all five characteristics, but the detected rhythm slowed after anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) therapy, with an increase in R-R intervals of at least 60 ms, the detection was considered appropriate. If all characteristics were similar, but the ICD delivered a shock, the episode was classified as an SVT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The morphologic characteristics are illustrated below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shape</strong>: Successive beats in the EGM may be similar, differing, or in multiple sets of similar beats.</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"margin:1em auto; width:80%\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><em><strong>Monomorphic</strong>, </em>same basic shape from beat-to-beat</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><em><strong>Polymorphic</strong>, </em>the episode has many different shapes</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><em><strong>Multimorphic</strong>, </em>the episode has at least two distinct morphologies that may or may not be similar to SR</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Number of components that cross the baseline</strong>: Each component must be at least 10% of the peak-to-peak amplitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"margin:1em auto; width:80%\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>One component</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Two components</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Three components</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Initial slope</strong> may be positive or negative.</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"margin:1em auto; width:80%\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>First component positive</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>First component negative</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Position of the largest component</strong>: The largest component may be first, second, third, etc. In the example below, at left the second component is largest; at right, the first is largest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notching</strong>: A component (defined as a portion of the signal that does not cross the baseline) may contain a notch.

Each VT/VF episode file contain a total of 1024 cells of the R-R intervals. As you look at the episode files in Excel, the last cell in the spreadsheet for the detected episodes, are the intervals just prior to detection. For example, in episode file 0003.vt5, the last interval prior to detection is 390 ms which would be found in column A, cell number 1024. The detected episodes are stored only until the initial detection by the ICD (not episode termination). The Most Recent interval files have less than 1024 intervals (range from 986-1022). The least recent intervals are lost during the interrogation process and the number of intervals lost is variable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database was contributed to PhysioNet by Medtronic, Inc., for use by researchers to study precursors and possible predictors of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

A revised version of this database was posted on 1 September 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Subjects</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Subjects were randomly selected over a 6-month period (September 02 to February 03) from patients referred to the Sleep Disorders Clinic at St Vincent&#39;s University Hospital, Dublin, for possible diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea or primary snoring. Subjects had to be above 18 years of age, with no known cardiac disease, autonomic dysfunction, and not on medication known to interfere with heart rate. Twenty-five subjects (21M, 4F) were selected (age: 50 &plusmn; 10 years, range 28-68 years; BMI: 31.6 &plusmn; 4.0 kg/m&sup2;, range 25.1-42.5 kg/m&sup2;; AHI: 24.1 &plusmn; 20.3, range 1.7-90.9). Details are shown in <a href=\"SubjectDetails.xls\">SubjectDetails.xls</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Signals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Polysomnograms were obtained using the Jaeger-Toennies system (Erich Jaeger GmbH, Germany). Signals recorded were: EEG (C3-A2), EEG (C4-A1), left EOG, right EOG, submental EMG, ECG (modified lead V2), oro-nasal airflow (thermistor), ribcage movements, abdomen movements (uncalibrated strain gauges), oxygen saturation (finger pulse oximeter), snoring (tracheal microphone) and body position.

    "full_description": "<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is one of the most common movement disorders, affecting approximately 1 million Americans (estimates range between 4 and 6.5 million people worldwide) and about 1% of older adults. In the US alone, 60,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. PD is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that results in tremor, rigidity, slowness, and postural instability. A disturbed gait is a common, debilitating symptom; patients with severe gait disturbances are prone to falls and may lose their functional independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This database contains measures of gait from 93 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age: 66.3 years; 63% men), and 73 healthy controls (mean age: 66.3 years; 55% men). The database includes the vertical ground reaction force records of subjects as they walked at their usual, self-selected pace for approximately 2 minutes on level ground. Underneath each foot were 8 sensors (<a href=\"http://www.infotronic.nl/#CDG\" target=\"other\">Ultraflex Computer Dyno Graphy, Infotronic Inc.</a>) that measure force (in Newtons) as a function of time. The output of each of these 16 sensors has been digitized and recorded at 100 samples per second, and the records also include two signals that reflect the sum of the 8 sensor outputs for each foot. For details about the format of the data, please see <a href=\"format.txt\">this note</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this information, one can investigate the force record as a function of time and location, derive measures that reflect the center-of-pressure as a function of time, and determine timing measures (e.g., stride time, swing time) for each foot as functions of time. Thus, one can study the stride-to-stride dynamics and the variability of these time series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This database also includes demographic information, measures of disease severity (i.e., using the Hoehn &amp; Yahr staging and/or the Unified Parkinson&#39;s Disease Rating Scale) and other related measures (available in <a href=\"demographics.html\">HTML</a> or <a href=\"demographics.xls\">xls spreadsheet</a> format).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A subset of the database includes measures recorded as subjects performed a second task (serial 7 subtractions) while walking, as in the figure above, which shows excerpts of swing time series from a patient with PD (lower panels) and a control subject (upper panels), under usual walking conditions (at left) and when performing serial 7 subtractions (at right). Under usual walking conditions, variability is larger in the patient with PD (Coefficient of Variation = 2.7%), compared to the control subject (CV = 1.3%). Variability increases during dual tasking in the subject with PD (CV = 6.5%), but not in the control subject (CV = 1.2%). From Yogev et al.

This database consists of 90 annotated excerpts of ambulatory ECG recordings from 79 subjects. The subjects were 70 men aged 30 to 84, and 8 women aged 55 to 71. (Information is missing for one subject. Records e0118-e0122 come from the same subject; also records e0123-e0126, records e0129 and e0133, records e0136 and e0139, records e0147 and e0148, records e0154 and e0155, and records e0162 and e0163.) Myocardial ischemia was diagnosed or suspected for each subject (see reference 1); additional selection criteria were established in order to obtain a representative selection of ECG abnormalities in the database, including baseline ST segment displacement resulting from conditions such as hypertension, ventricular dyskinesia, and effects of medication. The database includes 367 episodes of ST segment change, and 401 episodes of T-wave change, with durations ranging from 30 seconds to several minutes, and peak displacements ranging from 100 microvolts to more than one millivolt. In addition, 11 episodes of axis shift resulting in apparent ST change, and 10 episodes of axis shift resulting in apparent T-wave change, have been marked. Compact clinical reports document each record. These reports, contained within the header (.hea) files associated with each record, summarize pathology, medications, electrolyte imbalance, and techical information about each recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each record is two hours in duration and contains two signals, each sampled at 250 samples per second with 12-bit resolution over a nominal 20 millivolt input range. The sample values were rescaled after digitization with reference to calibration signals in the original analog recordings, in order to obtain a uniform scale of 200 ADC units per millivolt for all signals. (The calibration signals are not included in the signal files.) The header files include information about the leads used, the patient&#39;s age, sex, and medications, the clinical findings, and the recording equipment. Each of the signal files is 5,400,000 bytes long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two cardiologists worked independently to annotate each record beat-by-beat and for changes in ST segment and T-wave morphology, rhythm, and signal quality. ST segment and T-wave changes were identified in both leads (using predefined criteria which were applied uniformily in all cases), and their onsets, extrema, and ends were annotated. Annotations made by the two cardiologists were compared, disagreements were resolved by the coordinating group in Pisa (see reference 3), and the reference annotation files were prepared; altogether, these files contain 802,866 annotations. A detailed description of the annotations may be found <a href=\"annotations.shtml\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over half (48 of 90 complete records, and reference annotation files for all records) of this database was contributed to PhysioNet in 2000, and the remainder was contributed in November 2009.

(Case chb21 was obtained 1.5 years after case chb01, from the same female subject.) The file <a href=\"SUBJECT-INFO\">SUBJECT-INFO</a> contains the gender and age of each subject. (Case chb24 was added to this collection in December 2010, and is not currently included in SUBJECT-INFO.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each case (chb01, chb02, etc.) contains between 9 and 42 continuous .edf files from a single subject. Hardware limitations resulted in gaps between consecutively-numbered .edf files, during which the signals were not recorded; in most cases, the gaps are 10 seconds or less, but occasionally there are much longer gaps. In order to protect the privacy of the subjects, all protected health information (PHI) in the original .edf files has been replaced with surrogate information in the files provided here. Dates in the original .edf files have been replaced by surrogate dates, but the time relationships between the individual files belonging to each case have been preserved. In most cases, the .edf files contain exactly one hour of digitized EEG signals, although those belonging to case chb10 are two hours long, and those belonging to cases chb04, chb06, chb07, chb09, and chb23 are four hours long; occasionally, files in which seizures are recorded are shorter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All signals were sampled at 256 samples per second with 16-bit resolution. Most files contain 23 EEG signals (24 or 26 in a few cases). The <a href=\"http://www.bem.fi/book/13/13.htm#03\" target=\"other\">International 10-20 system</a> of EEG electrode positions and nomenclature was used for these recordings. In a few records, other signals are also recorded, such as an ECG signal in the last 36 files belonging to case chb04 and a vagal nerve stimulus (VNS) signal in the last 18 files belonging to case chb09. In some cases, up to 5 &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; signals (named &quot;-&quot;) were interspersed among the EEG signals to obtain an easy-to-read display format; these dummy signals can be ignored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The file <a href=\"RECORDS\">RECORDS</a> contains a list of all 664 .edf files included in this collection, and the file <a href=\"RECORDS-WITH-SEIZURES\">RECORDS-WITH-SEIZURES</a> lists the 129 of those files that contain one or more seizures. In all, these records include 198 seizures (182 in the original set of 23 cases); the beginning ([) and end (]) of each seizure is annotated in the .seizure annotation files that accompany each of the files listed in RECORDS-WITH-SEIZURES. In addition, the files named chb<em>nn</em>-summary.txt contain information about the montage used for each recording, and the elapsed time in seconds from the beginning of each .edf file to the beginning and end of each seizure contained in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Relevant Publications</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the thesis cited at the top of this page, these publications describe a patient-specific seizure onset detection algorithm, and the first of them describes its evaluation using this database:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ali Shoeb, John Guttag. <a href=\"shoeb-icml-2010.pdf\">Application of Machine Learning to Epileptic Seizure Onset Detection.</a> <em>27th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)</em>, June&nbsp;21-24, 2010, Haifa, Israel.</p>\r\n<!-- end reference -->\r\n\r\n<p>Ali Shoeb, Herman Edwards, Jack Connolly, Blaise Bourgeois, S.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database, created and contributed by Michael J. Epstein and Ikaro Silva, was generated as part of a study examining evoked potentials and loudness growth. The database consists of two sets of physiological signals: auditory brainstem response (ABR) and otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and two sets of psychoacoustical estimates of loudness as a function of peak sound pressure level (peSPL). The ABRs were recorded simultaneously with the OAEs in a sound-attenuating, electrically shielded booth. Listeners had three electrodes affixed: the non-inverting electrode was positioned on the forehead, the inverting electrode was positioned on the ipsilateral mastoid (behind the ear), and the ground electrode positioned on the contralateral mastoid. (These locations were scrubbed with alcohol prior to the electrode placement.) The electrode signal was then sent to a GRASS QP511 Quad AC Amplifier, where it was band-pass filtered from 30-3000 Hz, amplified by a factor of 50000, sent to a 32-bit Lynx Two Soundcard (outside the booth), and sampled at 48 kHz. The effective resolution of the recording was 24-bits. Stimuli were presented at a presentation rate of about 24 Hz (2002 samples/trial).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the raw data, for each level, two zero-mean weighted averages of ABR and OAE recordings were made. The first average consisted of a weighted mean (Elberling and Wahlgreen, 1985) of all the trials in the first half, and the second average consisted of a weighted mean of all the trials in the second half. For each frequency, the stimulus was presented in ascending order from the listener&rsquo;s threshold to 100 dB peSPL in steps of 5 dB. Threshold was determined from the maximum threshold of the CMM or ME procedure. For the average ABR recordings, an artifact rejection threshold of 50 uV was applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For each subject N<em>x</em>, you will find the following files:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Averaged Data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>N<em>x</em>_evoked_ave<em>level</em>_F<em>freq</em>_R<em>rep</em>.dat</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(binary) signal file containing the ABR and OAE signals</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N<em>x</em>_evoked_ave<em>level</em>_F<em>freq</em>_R<em>rep</em>.hea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(text) header file, with comments indicating the sex, ear presented, and age of the subject, number of trials used in the average, estimated residual noise level, and estimated weighted signal-to-noise ratio (wnsfmp)</p>\r\n<!--\r\n<dt>\r\n<tt>N<em>x</em>_evoked_ave_.hea</tt>\r\n<dd>\r\n(text) main header file for subject <tt>N<em>x</em></tt>\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<p>N<em>x</em>_LoudnessData_F<em>freq</em>.txt</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(text) the zero-mean loudness measurements (in log units) obtained via psychoacoustical procedures (magnitude estimation and cross-modality matching) at each of the measured levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Raw Data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>N<em>x</em>_evoked_raw<em>level</em>_F<em>freq</em>_R<em>rep</em>.dat</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(binary) signal file containing the ABR and OAE signals</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N<em>x</em>_evoked_raw<em>level</em>_F<em>freq</em>_R<em>rep</em>.hea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(text) header file, with comments indicating stimulus level, stimulus frequency, ear presented, trial length (samples) and condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N<em>x</em>_evoked_raw<em>level</em>_F<em>freq</em>_R<em>rep</em>.trg</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(binary) annotation file, in which the T annotation indicates the onset of the trial (with respect to stimulus onset).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>where:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>x</em> = listener ID number (1-8)<br />\r\n<em>level</em> = peSPL of the stimulus (starting from the listener&#39;s threshold and increasing in steps of 5 dB until 100 dB peSPL)<br />\r\n<em>freq</em> = stimulus frequency in KHz<br />\r\n<em>rep</em> = number indicating if it&#39;s either the first or second independent average</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fewer than 20% of the cases, one of the channels was severely corrupted by electrical artifacts and has been removed from the files (the record names in these cases end with _x).

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Salt-sensitive hypertension is known to be associated with dysfunction of the baroreflex control system in the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat. However, neither the physiological mechanisms nor the genomic regions underlying the baroreflex dysfunction seen in this rat model are definitively known. Here, we have adopted a mathematical modeling approach to investigate the physiological and genetic origins of baroreflex dysfunction in the Dahl SS rat. We have developed a computational model of the overall baroreflex heart rate control system based on known physiological mechanisms to analyze telemetry-based blood pressure and heart rate data from two genetic strains of rat, the SS and consomic SS.13BN, on low- and high-salt diets. With this approach, physiological parameters are estimated, unmeasured physiological variables related to the baroreflex control system are predicted, and differences in these quantities between the two strains of rat on low- and high-salt diets are detected. Specific findings include: a significant selective impairment in sympathetic gain with high-salt diet in SS rats and a protection from this impairment in SS.13BN rats, elevated sympathetic and parasympathetic offsets with high-salt diet in both strains, and an elevated sympathetic tone with high-salt diet in SS but not SS.13BN rats. In conclusion, we have associated several important physiological parameters of the baroreflex control system with chromosome 13 and have begun to identify possible physiological mechanisms underlying baroreflex impairment and hypertension in the Dahl SS rat that may be further explored in future experimental and modeling-based investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pressure-Time series Data</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The four *.txt (text) files below contain continuous blood pressure recordings for 9 Dahl SS rats and 6 Dahl SS.13BN rats, under high and low salt conditions.

    "full_description": "<h3>The Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) of EEG Activity During Sleep</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) is a periodic EEG activity occurring during NREM sleep. It is characterized by cyclic sequences of cerebral activation (phase A) followed by periods of deactivation (phase B) which separate two successive phase A periods with an interval &lt;1 min. A phase A period and the following phase B period define a CAP cycle, and at least two CAP cycles are required to form a CAP sequence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See <strong>CAP-sequence.jpg</strong> for an example of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) in sleep stage 2. A CAP cycle is defined as a phase A period followed by a phase B period lasting a minute or less. Two or more adjacent CAP cycles define a CAP sequence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phase A periods are subdivided into three subtypes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Subtype A1: synchronized events with low impact on autonomic and somatomotor activities;</li>\r\n\t<li>Subtype A2: mixed synchronized&ndash;desynchronized EEG events with an intermediate influence on the autonomic and somatomotor activities; and</li>\r\n\t<li>Subtype A3: predominantly desynchronized EEG events with heavy effects on the autonomic and somatomotor activities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A detailed description and definition of CAP is reported in <a href=\"#ref01\">[1]</a>. For a complete review of the history and significance of CAP, see <a href=\"#ref02\">[2]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being a physiological phenomenon, CAP is also a marker of sleep instability and can be correlated with several sleep-related pathologies. In fact, on one hand CAP can reflect a reaction of the sleeping brain to any endogenous or exogenous disturbance; on the other hand, the A phase of CAP has been interpreted as a kind of gate through which pathological events more easily occur <a href=\"#ref03\">[3]</a>. Increased amounts of CAP are often observed in <strong>sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)</strong>, as well as in <strong>insomnia</strong> <a href=\"#ref04\">[4]</a>, sleep movement disorders (<strong>periodic leg movements</strong>, or <strong>PLM</strong> <a href=\"#ref05\">[5]</a>, <strong>restless leg syndrome (RLS)</strong> <a href=\"#ref06\">[6]</a>, parasomnias like <strong>REM behavior disorder (RBD)</strong>, and epileptic diseases such as <strong>nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE)</strong> <a href=\"#ref07\">[7]</a>. Pathological amounts of CAP can also be found in hypersomnias of central origin such as <strong>narcolepsy</strong> <a href=\"#ref08\">[8]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ratio between NREM CAP sleep and total NREM sleep (CAP-rate), and the different distributions of CAP A phases with respect to sleep stages can be measured in sleep centers to characterize such pathologies. These indexes can be valuable as measures of sleep quality, but the time needed to determine them has been an obstacle to their adoption in routine clinical practice, since visual scoring of CAP phases A for an entire night of sleep recording requires expertise and lengthy, attentive analysis. The development of software capable of increasingly accurate and efficient automated analysis of CAP is beginning to result in wider clinical use of CAP indexes for diagnosis of sleep pathologies and assessment of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The CAP Sleep Database</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The CAP Sleep Database is a collection of 108 polysomnographic recordings registered at the Sleep Disorders Center of the Ospedale Maggiore of Parma, Italy. The waveforms (contained in the .edf files of the database) include at least 3 EEG channels (F3 or F4, C3 or C4 and O1 or O2, referred to A1 or A2), EOG (2 channels), EMG of the submentalis muscle, bilateral anterior tibial EMG, respiration signals (airflow, abdominal and thoracic effort and SaO2) and EKG.

The 92 pathological recordings include 40 recordings of patients diagnosed with NFLE, 22 affected by RBD, 10 with PLM, 9 insomniac, 5 narcoleptic, 4 affected by SDB and 2 by bruxism. The age and gender of the subjects are reported in a spreadsheet (<a href=\"gender-age.xlsx\">gender-age.xlsx</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recordings are named according to the subjects&#39; pathology:</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>n1-n16</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>No pathology (controls)</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>brux1-brux2</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Bruxism</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>ins1-ins9</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Insomnia</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>narco1-narco5</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Narcolepsy</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>nfle1-nfle40</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>plm1-plm10</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Periodic leg movements</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>rbd1-rbd22</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>REM behavior disorder</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>sdb1-sdb4</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Sleep-disordered breathing</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h3>Annotations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Expert neurologists trained at the Sleep Center provided the scoring of the sleep macrostructure, according to the Rechtschaffen &amp; Kales rules <a href=\"#ref09\">[9]</a>, while the CAP was detected in agreement with Terzano&rsquo;s reference atlas of rules <a href=\"#ref10\">[10]</a>. All the signals were visualized and the scorings were performed using REMlogic&trade; software (Embla).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scores for each recording are provided as .txt files in REMlogic report format, and also as .st files in PhysioBank-compatible format. The .txt score files have the following fields:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Sleep stage (W=wake, S1-S4=sleep stages, R=REM, MT=body movements)</li>\r\n\t<li>Body position (Left, Right, Prone, or Supine; not recorded in some subjects)</li>\r\n\t<li>Time of day [hh:mm:ss]</li>\r\n\t<li>Event (either a sleep stage (SLEEP-S0..S4, REM, MT), or a phase A of CAP)</li>\r\n\t<li>Duration (in seconds)</li>\r\n\t<li>Location (the signal(s) in which the event can be observed)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A Matlab script is provided for reading the .txt score files easily. By launching <a href=\"ScoringReader.m\">ScoringReader.m</a>, an array containing the scoring of the macrostructure, and three arrays containing the starting time of the CAP A phases, their duration and their subtype, are generated. The hypnogram is reported as 0 for wake, 1 to 4 for the sleep stages, according to R&amp;K rules, and 5 for REM. The Matlab function <a href=\"CAP.m\">CAP.m</a> computes, starting from these variables, the CAP time and CAP rate according to Terzano&rsquo;s rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The .st score files can be read using the PhysioBank ATM and other software that reads PhysioBank-compatible annotation files. These files contain the same information as the .txt files; times are encoded as for other annotation files, and each annotation&#39;s aux string contains the associated event, duration, sleep stage, location, and (where available) body position.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Applications for this database</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database is intended to provide a useful number of carefully annotated examples of CAP in a representative variety of pathophysiologic contexts, for development and evaluation of automated CAP analyzers, as well as to support basic studies of the dynamics of CAP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several efforts have been made to develop a reliable automatic CAP-scoring algorithm <a href=\"#ref11\">[11]</a>. Most of these methods rely on the extraction of spectral features from the EEG and on the application of machine-learning algorithms. Although all these methods achieve good results, none of them is yet applied to clinical practice since they either require some amount of clinician intervention or do not achieve a sufficient accuracy in the classification to support the clinical diagnosis. Some recordings from this database have been used for studies on features related to CAP phase A <a href=\"#ref12\">[12-16]</a> and for training automatic CAP detection algorithms <a href=\"#ref17\">[17]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The CAP Sleep Database was contributed to PhysioNet by Professor Mario Giovanni Terzano, MD and Professor Liborio Parrino, MD.

Correctly diagnosing fetal distress is essential for preventing fetal morbidity, as well as avoiding unnecessary cesarean sections. The OB-1 Database was collected to support development of a diagnostic system based on advanced signal processing of nonstationary signals recorded during electronic fetal monitoring. The contributors of the data (Nancy Oriol, Fred Bennet, and Prateek Aggarwal) have previously developed the signal processing technology for this purpose. The technology is based on the premise that changes in fetal oxygenation can be identified by monitoring spectral and temporal changes in fetal heart rate variability, and correlations between fetal heart rate variability and uterine contraction signal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This directory currently contains a sample recording from the OB-1 Database, for which more than 100 data sets have been collected. Each data set documents the in-hospital course of labor and delivery (typically several hours in length), and consists of a record containing a continuous fetal ECG signal and a simultaneously recorded UC (uterine muscular activity) signal, accompanied by maternal clinical data and newborn clinical data. The data sets were obtained from human subjects, and certificates of approval for conducting research using the data were obtained from the participating institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction of the remainder of the database is in progress on PhysioNetWorks. See the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/works/OB1FetalHeartRateVariability\">OB1 Fetal Heart Rate Variability</a> project home page (PhysioNetWorks login required) for details.

The recordings were acquired in the Department of Obstetrics at the Medical University of Silesia, by means of the KOMPOREL system for acquisition and analysis of fetal electrocardiogram (ITAM Institute, Zabrze, Poland). Each recording comprises four differential signals acquired from maternal abdomen and the reference direct fetal electrocardiogram registered from the fetal head.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The configuration of the abdominal electrodes comprised four electrodes placed around the navel, a reference electrode placed above the pubic symphysis and a common mode reference electrode (with active-ground signal) placed on the left leg. To reduce the skin impedance, the areas under the Ag-AgCl electrodes were abraded. In all cases, the scalp electrode was placed for a clinical indication and all women consented to participate in this study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The acquisition of direct fetal electrocardiogram was carried out with a typical spiral electrode, commonly used in a direct FECG channel of popular fetal monitors. The R-wave locations were automatically determined in the direct FECG signal by means of on-line analysis applied in the KOMPOREL system. These locations were then verified (off-line) by a group of cardiologists, resulting in a set of reference markers precisely indicating the R-wave locations. The markers have been stored together with the direct and indirect FECG signals in EDF/EDF+ format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provided recordings constitute an excellent material for testing and evaluation of efficacy of new FECG processing techniques, e.g. algorithms for suppression of maternal electrocardiogram in abdominal signals or for detection of fetal QRS complexes. In the authors&#39; studies (1-4 above), these recordings were used to evaluate the accuracy of fetal heart rate measurement and to estimate its influence on the quantification of the beat-to-beat fetal heart rate (FHR) variability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recording information: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Signals recorded in labor, between 38 and 41 weeks of gestation</li>\r\n\t<li>Four signals acquired from maternal abdomen</li>\r\n\t<li>Direct electrocardiogram recorded simultaneously from fetal head</li>\r\n\t<li>Positioning of electrodes was constant during all recordings</li>\r\n\t<li>Ag-AgCl electrodes (3M Red Dot 2271) and abrasive material to improve skin conductance (3M Red Dot Trace Prep 2236)</li>\r\n\t<li>Bandwidth: 1Hz - 150Hz (synchronous sampling of all signals)</li>\r\n\t<li>Additional digital filtering for removal of power-line interference (50Hz) and baseline drift</li>\r\n\t<li>Sampling rate: 1 kHz</li>\r\n\t<li>Resolution: 16 bits</li>\r\n\t<li>Input ranges are included in the records in EDF format</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Related Publications</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Jezewski J, Matonia A, Kupka T, Roj D, Czabanski R. <a href=\"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bmte.ahead-of-print/bmt-2011-0130/bmt-2011-0130.xml\" target=\"other\">&gt;Determination of the fetal heart rate from abdominal signals: evaluation of beat-to-beat accuracy in relation to the direct fetal electrocardiogram</a>. <em>Biomedical Engineering/Biomedizinische Technik</em> 2012 Jul;57(5):383-394. doi:10.1515/bmt-2011-0130.</li>\r\n\t<li>Matonia A, Jezewski J, Kupka T, Horoba K, Wrobel J, Gacek A. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16937181\" target=\"other\">The influence of coincidence of fetal and maternal QRS complexes on fetal heart rate reliability</a>. <em>Medical &amp; Biological Engineering &amp; Computing</em> 2006;44(5):393-403.</li>\r\n\t<li>Kotas M, Jezewski J, Horoba L, Matonia A. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20701992\" target=\"other\">Application of spatio-temporal filtering to fetal electrocardiogram enhancement</a>. <em>Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine</em>. 2011 Oct;104(1):1-9.</li>\r\n\t<li>Kotas M, Jezewski J, Matonia A, Kupka T. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19819040\" target=\"other\">Towards noise immune detection of fetal QRS complexes</a>. <em>Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine</em>. 2010 Mar;97(3):241-256.</li>\r\n</ol>",

    "full_description": "<h3><!-- added by KP, 12 June 2015 -->Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The sleep-edf database contains 197 whole-night PolySomnoGraphic sleep recordings, containing EEG, EOG, chin EMG, and event markers. Some records also contain respiration and body temperature. Corresponding hypnograms (sleep patterns) were manually scored by well-trained technicians according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales manual, and are also available. The data comes from two studies, briefly described below, and in detail in <a href=\"#ref1\">[1,2]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data and Annotation Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>*PSG.edf</strong> files are whole-night polysmnographic sleep recordings containing EEG (from Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz electrode locations), EOG (horizontal), submental chin EMG, and an event marker. The <strong>SC*PSG.edf</strong> files (see the &#39;sleep cassette study&#39;) often also contain oro-nasal respiration and rectal body temperature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>*Hypnogram.edf</strong> files contain annotations of the sleep patterns that correspond to the PSGs. These patterns (hypnograms) consist of sleep stages W, R, 1, 2, 3, 4, M (Movement time) and ? (not scored). All hypnograms were manually scored by well-trained technicians (identified by the eighth letter of the hypnogram filename) according to the 1968 Rechtschaffen and Kales manual <a href=\"#ref3\">[3]</a>, but based on Fpz-Cz/Pz-Oz EEGs instead of C4-A1/C3-A2 EEGs, as suggested by <a href=\"#ref4\">[4]</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All EDF header fields also comply with the EDF+ specs, and unrecorded signals were removed from the ST*PSG.edf files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PSG files are formatted in EDF while the hypnograms are in EDF+. The specifications of EDF and EDF+ are on <a href=\"http://www.edfplus.info\" target=\"other\">www.edfplus.info</a> and in <a href=\"#ref5\">[5,6]</a>. Each EDF and EDF+ file has a header specifying the patient (in these files anonymized to only gender and age), details of the recording (in particular the recorded time period), and characteristics of the signals including their amplitude calibration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sleep Cassette Study and Data</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The 153 <strong>SC*</strong> files (SC = Sleep Cassette) were obtained in a 1987-1991 study of age effects on sleep in healthy Caucasians aged 25-101, without any sleep-related medication [2]. Two PSGs of about 20 hours each were recorded during two subsequent day-night periods at the subjects homes. Subjects continued their normal activities but wore a modified Walkman-like cassette-tape recorder described in chapter VI.4 (page 92) of Bob&rsquo;s 1987 thesis [7].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Files are named in the form SC4<strong>ssN</strong>EO-PSG.edf where <strong>ss</strong> is the subject number, and <strong>N</strong> is the night. The first nights of subjects 36 and 52, and the second night of subject 13, were lost due to a failing cassette or laserdisk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EOG and EEG signals were each sampled at 100 Hz. The submental-EMG signal was electronically highpass filtered, rectified and low-pass filtered after which the resulting EMG envelope expressed in uV rms (root-mean-square) was sampled at 1Hz. Oro-nasal airflow, rectal body temperature and the event marker were also sampled at 1Hz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subjects and recordings are further described in the file headers, the descriptive spreadsheet <strong>SC-subjects.xls</strong>, and in [2].</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sleep Telemetry Study and Data</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The 44 <strong>ST*</strong> files (ST = Sleep Telemetry) were obtained in a 1994 study of temazepam effects on sleep in 22 Caucasian males and females without other medication. Subjects had mild difficulty falling asleep but were otherwise healthy. The PSGs of about 9 hours were recorded in the hospital during two nights, one of which was after temazepam intake, and the other of which was after placebo intake. Subjects wore a miniature telemetry system with very good signal quality described in [8].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Files are named in the form ST7<strong>ssN</strong>J0-PSG.edf where <strong>ss</strong> is the subject number, and <strong>N</strong> is the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EOG, EMG and EEG signals were sampled at 100 Hz, and the event marker at 1 Hz. The physical marker dimension ID+M-E relates to the fact that pressing the marker (M) button generated two-second deflections from a baseline value that either identifies the telemetry unit (ID = 1 or 2 if positive) or marks an error (E) in the telemetry link if negative. Subjects and recordings are further described in the file headers, the descriptive spreadsheet <strong>ST-subjects.xls</strong>, and in [1].</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Software for viewing EDF and EDF+ files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Both EDF and EDF+ formats are free and can be viewed using free software such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"Polyman/\">Polyman</a> (for MS-Windows only; for details, please follow the link)</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.teuniz.net/edfbrowser/\" target=\"other\">EDFbrowser</a> (for Linux, Mac OS X, and MS-Windows; at <a href=\"http://www.teuniz.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.teuniz.net</a>)</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"/lightwave/\">LightWAVE</a> and the <a href=\"/ATM\">PhysioBank ATM</a>, platform-independent web applications from PhysioNet</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"/physiotools/wug/\">WAVE</a> and other applications for Linux, Mac OS X, and MS-Windows in the <a href=\"/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB Software Package</a>, also from PhysioNet</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>An easy way to view these recordings using Polyman is to select <em>File &rarr; Open &rarr; File(s)...</em> to open a PSG.edf file and its corresponding .Hypnogram.edf file; then select <em>File &rarr; Apply Template &rarr; Browse...</em> to open <a href=\"Polyman/SC-cassette.xml\">SC-cassette.xml</a> (for an SC PSG) or <a href=\"Polyman/ST-telemetry.xml\">ST-telemetry.xml</a> (for an ST PSG).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications using <a href=\"/physiotools/wfdb.shtml#library\">WFDB library</a> version 10.4.5 (February 2008) or later can read EDF files directly with no conversion required.

Thanks to this feature, it can be useful as a teaching tool for medical students and others, and also for testing algorithms of fetal heart rate extraction from fetal phonocardiographic recordings, as described in [2].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before developing the simulation software, a data collection pilot study was conducted with the purpose of specifically identifying the characteristics of the waveforms of the fetal and maternal heart sounds, since the available literature is not rigorous in this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simulated PCGs were generated as a sequence of frames, each of them including simulated S1 and S2 wavelets, corrupted by noise. The noise is a sum of different contributions that simulate vibrations created by maternal heart sounds, maternal body organs sound (due to maternal digestion, respiratory muscular movements, placental blood turbulence), fetal movements, surrounding environment and additive white Gaussian noise. Different levels of noise were simulated. In particular, these simulated PCGs are characterized by a range of SNR values that could be typically found in real recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the details about the pilot study and the simulation of the PCG signals are described in [1].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recording information:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Signals simulated with different SNR values from -26.7 dB to -4.4 dB</li>\r\n\t<li>SNR value is included in the file name</li>\r\n\t<li>Sampling rate: 1 kHz</li>\r\n\t<li>Resolution: 16 bits (format 16)</li>\r\n\t<li>Gain: 1</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Project collaborators</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mariano Ruffo, Mario Cesarelli, Maria Romano, and Paolo Bifulco, all from the University of Naples, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Napoli, Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Cesarelli M, Ruffo M, Romano M, Bifulco P. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260711003130\" target=\"other\">Simulation of foetal phonocardiographic recordings for testing of FHR extraction algorithms</a>. <em>Comput Methods Programs Biomed</em> 2012 Sep;107(3):513-23.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ruffo M, Cesarelli M, Romano M, Bifulco P, Fratini A. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809410000078\" target=\"other\">An algorithm for FHR estimation from foetal phonocardiographic signals</a>. <em>Biomedical Signal Processing and Control</em> 2010 Jan; 5:131-141.</li>\r\n</ol>",

    "full_description": "<h3>Abstract</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This data collection, contributed to PhysioBank by Kevin Sweeney and colleagues at the National University of Ireland in Maynooth, contains examples of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings that have been created for evaluating artifact removal methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In each such recording, one or two pairs of similar physiological signals have been acquired from transducers in close proximity. (The EEG recordings contain one pair of signals. The fNIRS recordings contain two pairs of such signals, acquired at 690 nm and 830 nm wavelengths.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In each case, one of the two transducers has not been disturbed, while the other has been manipulated to produce motion artifacts of variable duration within each 2-minute interval of the recording. The motion of the disturbed transducer, and the lack of motion of the other transducer, are documented in each case by simultaneously recorded outputs of 3-axis accelerometers affixed to each transducer. Comparison of the &quot;ground truth&quot; signals obtained from the undisturbed transducer with the intermittently noisy signals obtained from the other transducer reveals high correlation during motion-free intervals and lower correlation during artifact-contaminated intervals. To evaluate the efficacy of artifact-removal methods for &quot;cleaning&quot; the contaminated signals, one may similarly compare the &quot;ground truth&quot; signals with the &quot;cleaned&quot; signals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first reference above (Sweeney 2012) describes how these recordings were made in detail, and illustrates their use in evaluation of a wide variety of previously described artifact removal methods. The second reference above (Sweeney 2013) presents a novel method, also evaluated using these recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CSV files</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original data recorded by Sweeney and colleagues are available here within a pair of zip archives in CSV format. Note that the fNIRS (or EEG) signals and the accelerometer signals were recorded simultaneously using independent recording systems; a software-generated trigger signal was recorded by both systems. <strong>In order to synchronize the accelerometer signals with the other signals, it is necessary to line up the corresponding transitions in the recorded trigger signals.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two versions of the trigger signals were produced. In the full version, recorded together with the fNIRS signals and with the accelerometer signals, the trigger signal initially rises to indicate the start of the experiment. The trigger signal transitions to a low value during intervals when motion artifact was produced, and returns to a high level in the clean intervals. The final transition from high to low signals the end of the experiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The version of the trigger signal recorded together with the EEG signals includes only the initial rise and final fall (marking the start and end of the experiment); it does not include the intervening transitions marking the noisy and clean intervals of the recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EEG signals and the accompanying trigger signal were digitized at 2048 Hz; the fNIRS signals and their trigger signal, at 25 Hz [*]; and the 3-axis accelerometer signals and their trigger signal, at 200 Hz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[*] Analysis of the trigger signals in the fNIRS recordings suggests that the actual sampling frequency was slightly slower, and was approximately 24.99305 Hz. This value was used to resynchronize the fNIRS signals with the accelerometer signals in the PhysioBank-compatible versions of these recordings (see below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>fNIRS CSV files</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the 9 trials included in fNIRS-csv.zip consists of 2 channels of highly correlated fNIRS data recorded from the pre-frontal cortex. Therefore each trial presents 4 signals (2x690 nm and 2x830 nm recordings). <strong>Note:</strong> In trials 5 and 8, the 690 nm recordings are poor and were not used in the studies referenced above and below. Columns in the TrialX.csv files represent:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Column 1: Sample index Column 2: Channel 1 : Raw 690 nm intensity : sampled @ 25 Hz Column 3: Channel 1 : Raw 830 nm intensity : sampled @ 25 Hz Column 4: Channel 2 : Raw 690 nm intensity : sampled @ 25 Hz Column 5: Channel 2 : Raw 830 nm intensity : sampled @ 25 Hz Column 6: Trigger data for fNIRS data : sampled @ 25 Hz Column 7: Accelerometer 1 : X-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 8: Accelerometer 1 : Y-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 9: Accelerometer 1 : Z-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 10: Accelerometer 2 : X-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 11: Accelerometer 2 : Y-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 12: Accelerometer 2 : Z-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 13: Trigger data for accelerometer data : sampled @ 200 Hz</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EEG CSV files</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the 23 trials included in EEG-csv.zip consists of 2 channels of highly correlated EEG data recorded from the pre-frontal cortex. Columns in the TrialX.csv files represent:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Column 1: Sample index Column 2: Channel 1 : Raw EEG : sampled @ 2048 Hz Column 3: Channel 2 : Raw EEG : sampled @ 2048 Hz Column 4: Trigger data for EEG data : sampled @ 2048 Hz Column 5: Accelerometer 1 : X-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 6: Accelerometer 1 : Y-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 7: Accelerometer 1 : Z-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 8: Accelerometer 2 : X-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 9: Accelerometer 2 : Y-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 10: Accelerometer 2 : Z-axis : sampled @ 200 Hz Column 11: Trigger data for accelerometer data : sampled @ 200 Hz</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PhysioBank-compatible files</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The *.hea, *.dat, and *.trigger files available here were derived from the contents of the CSV files described above. The signals are presented in the same order as for the columns of the original CSV files. The locations of the transitions in the trigger signals were used to resynchronize the data in each recording. The short intervals before the initial rise and after the final fall of the trigger signals were not included in these files. The *.trigger files are annotation files that mark the locations of the transitions in the synchronized trigger signals; <strong>R</strong> annotations mark rises in the trigger signal, and <strong>F</strong> annotations mark falls in the trigger (the beginnings of artifact-contaminated intervals). The fNIRS signals were digitally resampled at 200 Hz to match their accompanying accelerometer signals in these records. In the EEG records, the accelerometer signals were digitally resampled at 2048 Hz to match the EEG signals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Sweeney KT, Ayaz H, Ward TE, Izzetoglu M, McLoone SF, Onaral B. <a href=\"http://eprints.nuim.ie/4161/1/SMcL_06236173.pdf\" target=\"other\">A Methodology for Validating Artifact Removal Techniques for Physiological Signals</a>. <em>IEEE Trans Info Tech Biomed</em> <strong>16</strong>(5):918-926; 2012 (Sept).</li>\r\n\t<li>Sweeney KT, McLoone SF, Ward TE. <a href=\"http://eprints.nuim.ie/4364/1/TW_Ensemble_Empirical.pdf\" target=\"other\">The Use of Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition With Canonical Correlation Analysis as a Novel Artifact Removal Technique</a>. <em>IEEE Trans Biomed Eng</em> <strong>60</strong>(1):97-105; 2013 (Jan).</li>\r\n</ul>",

During that period, subjects were asked to focus on the target character and to mentally count the number of times it was highlighted. From subject 03 onwards, subjects were asked to report their final count at the end of the run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the recordings, subjects were seated comfortably with the neck supported by a C-shaped inflatable travel pillow to reduce muscular artefacts. The eyes were at approximately 80 cm from a 22-inch LCD screen with 60 Hz refresh rate. Data were collected using a BioSemi ActiveTwo EEG system sampled at 2048 Hz. The signals recorded comprise 64 EEG electrodes (locations are specified <a href=\"http://www.biosemi.com/download/Cap_coords_all.xls\" target=\"other\">here</a>), two earlobes (EARL and EARR) for referencing, and vertical and horizontal electrooculograms (VEOGL, VEOGR, HEOGL, and HEOGR) for artefact removal. The signals are referenced to the CMS electrode (see <a href=\"http://www.biosemi.com/faq/cms&amp;drl.htm\" target=\"other\">BioSemi&#39;s FAQ</a> ). As this mode does not provide the full common mode rejection ratio (CMRR), the signals should be re-referenced via software (e.g., with respect to the average of EARL and EARR) to achieve the full CMRR and improve the signal-to-noise ratio.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data format</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The data are provided here in EDF+ format (containing the signals and an annotation channel). For use with PhysioToolkit software, <a href=\"/physiotools/wag/rdedfa-1.htm\">rdedfann</a> was used to generate a separate PhysioBank-compatible annotation file (with the suffix <strong>.event</strong>) for each record. The .event files and the EDF annotation channels in the corresponding EDF+ files contain identical data. In each record, annotations have the following structure:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>0:01.588 3252 #TgtP_RC01_SOA63</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>0:02.091 4282 #start</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>0:05.535 11336 MNOPQR</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>0:05.685 11643 STUVW</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>...</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>0:25.178 51565 FLRX4_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>0:30.122 61689 #counted22of22</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>0:30.375 62207 #end </em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The first annotation reports the target character (&ldquo;P&rdquo; in the example), the name of the run (RC01) and information about the duration of the stimuli timing (stimuli are on for 6 refresh cycles, i.e. 100 ms, and off for 3, i.e. 50 ms). The second annotation marks the beginning of the run while the last one its end. In the example, the penultimate annotation reports the number of target flashes counted by the subject and the actual number displayed. All other annotations report the timing of each intensification and the set of characters (in a row or column) being intensified.</p>",

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Preterm birth is a major health problem and the main cause of mortality and morbidity in new-borns. Studies on the electrohysterogram (EHG) have shown promising results regarding preterm labour prediction. A sixteen electrode recording system in a 4-by-4 configuration on the abdomen can provide information on the propagation of uterine electrical activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This database consists of 122 16-electrode EHG recordings performed on 45 pregnant women. The recordings were performed between 2008 and 2010 in Iceland. Pregnancy recordings, defined as recordings performed at antenatal care clinics on participants in the third trimester and not suspected to be in labour, were performed at Akureyri Primary Health Care Centre and Landspitali University Hospital. Labour recordings, defined as measurements performed on participants suspected to be in labour, present in the labour wards and who delivered within 24 hours, were performed at Landspitali University Hospital and Akureyri Hospital. Participants had normal singleton pregnancies and no known risk factors for preterm birth. After each pregnancy recording, the participant was invited to take part in another recording one to two weeks later. The protocol was approved by the National Bioethics Committee in Iceland (VSN 02-006-V4).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The measurements were performed using a sixteen channel multi-purpose physiological signal recorder (Embla A10), most commonly used for investigating sleep disorders. An anti-aliasing filter with a high cut-off frequency of 100 Hz was used but no high pass filter was used. The signal sampling rate was 200 Hz and the signal was digitized to 16 bits. The sixteen monopolar electrode signals were originally stored in the EDF (European Data Format) format by the Somnologica software used to control the Embla A10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A standardized 4-by-4 electrode EHG recording protocol, using reusable Ag/AgCl electrodes with a 13.0 mm outer diameter and an 8.0 mm inner diameter, were used for the recordings. The distance between electrode centres was 17.5 mm. The electrode numbering scheme, as seen when looking at the abdomen of the participant, can be seen in <strong>Figure1.jpg</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The desired position on the abdomen was with the third vertical line of electrodes (electrodes 9 to 12) placed on the median axis of the uterus and the 10th-11th pair of electrodes half way between the uterine fundus and pubic symphysis. The navel was avoided by displacing the matrix up or down, whilst staying as close as possible to the desired position. A patient ground electrode and a reference electrode were placed over the iliac crests on either side (sides not standardized). <strong>Figure2.jpg</strong> shows the electrode positions. The corner electrodes of the 4-by-4 grid are labelled and the black electrodes represent the patient ground and reference electrodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tocodynamometer was attached to the abdomen during recordings. When possible, a support, such as a pillow, was positioned under the right side of the participant to prevent potential aortocaval compression syndrome. During a recording, the researcher (AA) recorded participant movements, equipment manipulation, participant-reported possible contractions and foetal movements, and any other unusual events. The participant and researcher conversed freely during the recordings and no restrictions were placed on the participant in terms of changing position if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The intended duration of a pregnancy recording was one hour (actual average recording time was 61 minutes, range 19-86 minutes) and the intended duration of a labour recording was at least half an hour (actual average recording time was 36 minutes, range 8-64 minutes) but the participant could stop the measurement at any time. The majority of participants were measured repeatedly during the same pregnancy and took part in two to seven recordings. The lowest gestational age was 29 weeks and 5 days (29w5d - pregnancy recording) and the highest gestational age was 41 weeks and 5 days (41w5d - labour recording). A detailed description of the recording protocol can be found in the Scientific Data article.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Database Format</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>File names in the database are of the form ice###_*type*_*record number*, where ice### is the ID of the participant (e.g. ice001), *type* refers to the type of recording: - p (pregnancy) or l (labour), and *record number* is the number of recording for that particular participant (e.g. 1of3). Each recording has three associated files:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A scanned tocograph with a manually inserted recording time axis (.jgp file). Each small square represents 30 seconds.</li>\r\n\t<li>A binary signal (.dat) file containing the data from the 16 monopolar electrodes.</li>\r\n\t<li>A header (.hea) file.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The strings at the end of lines 2-17 in the header files correspond to the signal labels. The signals are labelled with &quot;EHGn&quot; where &quot;n&quot; refers to the relevant electrode number (electrode numbers are not in ascending order). Information from each recording is at the end of the header file and includes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Participant ID</li>\r\n\t<li>Record number</li>\r\n\t<li>Record type (labour, pregnancy)</li>\r\n\t<li>Age of participant (years)</li>\r\n\t<li>BMI (body mass index) of participant before pregnancy</li>\r\n\t<li>BMI of participant at time of recording</li>\r\n\t<li>Gravidity (number of times participant has been pregnant, including current pregnancy)</li>\r\n\t<li>Parity (previous births after 22 weeks gestation)</li>\r\n\t<li>Previous caesarean (Yes, No)</li>\r\n\t<li>Placental position</li>\r\n\t<li>Gestational age at recording (weeks/days), according to a first trimester ultrasound</li>\r\n\t<li>Gestational age at delivery (weeks/days)</li>\r\n\t<li>Mode of delivery (Vaginal, Vaginal/Induction, Elective caesarean, Emergency caesarean due to slow progress, Emergency caesarean due to other than slow progress). Vaginal delivery indicates spontaneous onset unless appended with /Induction.</li>\r\n\t<li>Synthetic oxytocin use in labour (Yes, No)</li>\r\n\t<li>Epidural during labour (Yes, No)</li>\r\n\t<li>Comments for recording</li>\r\n\t<li>Comments for delivery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For 111 of the recordings, there is also an annotation (.atr) file containing the type and timing of events, added manually using WAVE. The types of event are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>C - Contraction. Used when the participant feels a contraction or there is a very likely contraction on the tocograph (not always used when there is an obvious contraction on the tocograph).</li>\r\n\t<li>(c) - Possible contraction. Used when there is not a very likely contraction but the participant has pressure sensation or a contraction is suspected on the tocograph.</li>\r\n\t<li>pm - Participant movement.</li>\r\n\t<li>pos - Participant change of position.</li>\r\n\t<li>fm - Foetal movement. Used when the participant feels foetal movement.</li>\r\n\t<li>em - Equipment manipulation. Used when electrodes are pressed more firmly onto the abdomen if otherwise not explained in the comments.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The database also includes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The zip file icelandic16ehgmat.zip that includes MATLAB (.mat) versions of all the signal files along with header files (file names of the form ice###_*type*_*record number*m) and MATLAB (.mat) versions of the annotations (file names of the form ice###_*type*_*record number*m_ann). The MATLAB files contain the absolute raw units (divide by 131.068 to obtain the physical units in mV). Please note that the first sample of a signal file is indexed with 1 in the .mat files but with 0 in the .dat files and so there is an index number discrepancy of one between the two file formats (.mat and .dat).</li>\r\n\t<li>RECORDS.txt containing a list of the recordings by record name, with one record name per line.</li>\r\n\t<li>info.txt containing the clinical information from each recording (information from the header files excluding comments) along with recording durations and whether or not a recording has a corresponding annotation file.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Usage Notes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The annotations and the tocograph complement each other. Some contractions that are present in the annotations are not obvious on the tocograph and some obvious contractions on the tocograph are not in the annotations. This explains in part why some recordings are without annotations. Noted foetal movement could last for differing amounts of time and participants did not always notify if they felt foetal movement. Sometimes foetal movement can be seen on the tocograph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There can be differences in when participants start to feel a contraction or foetal movements and so differences in when participants notify about events. Events were therefore occasionally approximated to the nearest whole minute. There are also delays internal to the tocodynamometers. Due to factors such as these, the inserted recording times on the tocographs and the annotation times may be up to +/- 30 seconds from the actual recording or event times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though some pregnancies ended in caesarean, the participant was on occasion already in spontaneous labour. These incidences are explained in the comments sections of the header files. If a recording was close to birth, then the timing of the recording with regard to the birth is in the comments of the header file.</p>",

The research material in the SHAREE database included nominal 24-h electrocardiographic (ECG) Holter recordings of 139 hypertensive patients recruited at the Centre of Hypertension of the University Hospital of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECG Holter was performed after a one-month anti-hypertensive therapy wash-out. The patients, aged 55 and over (including 49 female and 90 male, age 72 - 7 years), were followed up for 12 months after the recordings in order to record major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, i.e. fatal or non-fatal acute coronary syndrome including myocardial infarctions, syncopal events, coronary revascularization, fatal or non-fatal stroke and transient ischemic attack. All the events were adjudicated by the Committee for Event Adjudication in the Hypertension Center. Adjudication was based on patient history, contact with the reference general practitioner and clinical records documenting the occurrence of the event/arrhythmia. Among the study sample, in the 12-month follow-up after recordings, 17 patients experienced a recorded event (11 myocardial infarctions, 3 strokes, 3 syncopal events). Moreover, the patients were evaluated by a cardiac and carotid ultrasonography. Left ventricular mass was determined by using the formula developed by Devereux as recommend by American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and divided by the body surface area to calculate left ventricular mass index (LVMi, g/m2). B-mode ultrasonography of carotid arteries was performed in order to compute the maximum intima media thickness (mm).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The individual recordings are each about 24 hours in duration, and contain three ECG signals each sampled at 128 samples per second with 8-bit precision. Annotation files (with the suffix .qrs) were prepared using an automated detector (WQRS) based on the length transform (Zong, W., G. B. Moody and D. Jiang. A robust open-source algorithm to detect onset and duration of QRS complexes. Computers in Cardiology, 2003: 737-740) and have not been corrected manually. Each recording is supplied with demographic and clinical information (e.g. age, gender, eventual vascular event, values of systolic and diastolic arteriosus pressure) availabe in the info.txt file.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This database was created by: <a href=\"mailto:paolomelillo85@gmail.com\">P.

All women were healthy and aged between 25 and 35 years old. The files were recorded in a private clinical practice in 2010 by means of a portable phonocardiographic device (Fetaphon Monitoring System by Pentavox) during sessions lasting 20 minutes on average. The data was digitized with a sampling frequency of 333 Hz at 8-bits ADC; for each file, gestational week (GW) and patient id (P) are reported in the file name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data were used to design software for fetal PCG signal simulation, and to develop and test algorithms for fetal heart rate extraction. All the details are described in the sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the recordings, it is possible to recognize the couple of the first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2 wavelets) where the signal is less corrupted by noise.

In order to convert the raw recorded values into physical units:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>For the membrane potential channel (1), multiply the values by 0.1 to remove the instrumentation gain. This gives the membrane potential in volts.</li>\r\n\t<li>For the stimulus current channel (2), apply the physical unit conversion, <em>1V = 5uA/cm2</em> to get the stimulus current in uA/cm2. Note that current recordings may have a DC offset due to the recording instrumentation, which does not reflect an offset of applied current. When the stimulation current is off, the baseline should be zero.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<!--\r\nThe <strong>physical</strong> directory contains the recordings converted into physical units by the PhysioNet team by applying the appropriate gains men\\\r\ntioned above and shifting current signals to zero baseline.

    "full_description": "<h3>Abstract</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>FECGSYNDB</em> is a large database of simulated adult and non-invasive fetal ECG (NI-FECG) signals, which provides a robust resource that enables reproducible research in the field. The data is generated using the <em>FECGSYN</em> simulator (<a href=\"http://fernandoandreotti.github.io/fecgsyn/\">visit website</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Experiment/Simulation Details</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The simulator represents maternal and foetal hearts as punctual dipoles with different magnitudes and spatial positions. This current version obtains foetal&ndash;maternal mixtures by treating each abdominal signal component (e.g. foetal/maternal ECG or noise signals) as an individual source, whose signal is propagated onto the observational points (&lsquo;electrodes&rsquo;). Therefore this database is able to provide separate waveform files for each signal source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modeled volume conductor, sampled from 34 channels (32 abdominal and 2 maternal ECG reference channels), is shown in <strong>fig1.png</strong>. The figure shows side (a) and upper (b) views the of volume conductor. Positions of foetal (small sphere, blue) and maternal (larger sphere, red) hearts shown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this database, ten different pregnancies were simulated. For each simulated pregnant subject, seven different physiological events were considered and simulated as described below:</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th style=\"width:25%\">Case</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Description</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Baseline</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Abdominal mixture (no noise or events)</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>0</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Baseline (no events) + noise</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Foetal movement + noise</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>MHR /FHR acceleration / decelerations + noise</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Uterine contraction + noise</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Ectopic beats (for both foetus and mother) + noise</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>5</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Additional NI-FECG (twin pregnancy) + noise</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of this, there were five different levels of additive noise and 5 repetitions for each combination of settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall a total of 10 (simulated pregnants) x 7 (cases) x 5 (SNR levels) x 5 (repetitions) = 1750 synthetic signals were produced, totaling 145.8 hours of multichannel data with 1.1 million fetal peaks. Each simulation had a duration of 5 minutes, and was sampled at 250 Hz with a 16-bit resolution.

As shown in Fig. 1 above, channels 1&ndash;32 are the abdominal FECG channels and channels 33-34 are the maternal reference ECG channels. Header files also contain additional model parameters described in table 2 of Andreotti et al. The units are listed as &#39;nu&#39; for no units since the signals are simulated, though their amplitudes do correspond to the 1&ndash;2mV amplitudes of normal MECG signals. Annotation files .qrs give machine generated QRS locations of their respective signals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contact</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions, suggestions or want to know more about <em>FECGSYNDB</em>, do not hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:fernando.andreotti@mailbox.tu-dresden.de;joachim.behar@eng.ox.ac.uk?subject=[Physionet - FECGSYNDB]\">contact us </a>.</p>",

Subjects were included if they were not previously clinically diagnosed with any gait or balance disorders, and if they were cognitively intact, with a Mini-Mental State Examination score above 24 points. Subjects were classified as fallers and nonfallers based on their self-report of previous falls. If subjects had at least 2 falls in the past year, they were considered fallers, otherwise they were considered non-fallers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Experimental Procedure</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The subjects underwent multiple protocols and evaluations:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Clinical and Traditional Fall Risk Assessment</strong>: Functional performance based assessments were performed in the laboratory including the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and the Four Square Step Test (FSST). The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC) were also performed. The results of these afforementioned tests can be found from column 29 of the <code>ClinicalDemogData_COFL.xlsx</code> spreadsheet.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Gait assessment in the Lab</strong>: Participants walked for 1 minute at a comfortable, self-selected speed while wearing a gait belt. A 3D accelerometer was worn on the lower back to quantify gait using previously validated methods. The accelerometer files recordings of these tests can be found in the <code>LabWalks</code> directory in MIT format.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Three-day Activities of Daily Living Assessment</strong>: After performing tests in the laboratory, participants were asked to wear a 3D accelerometer on their lower back for 3 consecutive days (except during activities like showering or swimming). Subjects received a diary for tracking when and why they took off and put on the device, shown in the <code>ReportHome75h.xlsx</code> spreadsheet.

There was a 7-day washout period between each 24\u2010hour treatment period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During each period, continuous ECGs were recorded at 500 Hz with an amplitude resolution of 2.5 &mu;V. From the continuous recording, triplicate 10\u2010second ECGs were extracted at 16 predefined time-points: 1 point pre-dose (-0.5 h) and 15 points post-dose (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, and 24 h), during which the subjects were resting in a supine position for 10 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At each of the 16 time-points, 3 optimal 10-second 12-lead ECGs were extracted with stable heart rates and maximum signal quality using Antares software (AMPS-LLC, New York City, NY). The resulting 5232 ECGs were up-sampled from 500 to 1000 Hz.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>raw</strong> directory contains the 5232 original extracted 10-second standard 12 lead ECG segments organized in subdirectories named after the subject number or randomization number <code>RANDID</code> in the second column of the <strong>SCR-002.Clinical.Data.csv</strong> file. The ECGs are stored in standard MIT format, with a signal <code>.dat</code> file and corresponding header <code>.hea</code> file for each segment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>medians</strong> directory contains derived representative median beats for 5223 of the 5232 raw ECG segments. Median beats were obtained as follows: the median PQRST waveform (median cardiac beat) for each lead was calculated by sample-by-sample synchronization of the QRS complex, and beats of a nonsinus origin were excluded based on a cross-correlation coefficient and RR interval history [1].</p>\r\n<!--\r\nThe median beats are derived from the independent leads (I\u2010II, V1 to V6) of the 10\u2010second 12\u2010lead ECGs. In addition to the standard 12 lead ECG channels, the median beat files also contain derived vector magnitude leads and their constituents (vx, vy, vz) for a total of 16 channels.-->\r\n\r\n<p>There are also semi-automatic annotations of each median beat based on the vector magnitude lead, containing P onset, QRS onset, QRS offset, T peak, secondary T peak (if present) and T offset. The annotations are stored in standard MIT annotation format, with annotator extension <code>.atr</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>SCR-002.Clinical.Data.csv</strong> file contains demographic information about the subjects, and important metadata about each ECG recording including their time-point, dosing period, associated drug, various beat intervals, and morphology measurements as described in Vicente et al.

    "full_description": "<h3>Abstract</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECGDMMLD database contains data from a randomized, double-blind, 5-period crossover clinical trial in 22 healthy male and female subjects, 18 to 35 years of age, to compare the electrophysiological response of hERG potassium channel blocking drugs with and without the addition of late sodium or calcium channel blocking drugs. The 5 treatment periods are 1) dofetilide alone, 2) mexiletine with and without dofetilide, 3) lidocaine with and without dofetilide, 4) moxifloxacin with and without diltiazem and 5) placebo. During each treatment period, 12 blood samples for pharmacokinetic measurements are obtained with matched 12-lead ECG recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Experimental Method</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In each of the five treatment periods, the subjects were dosed three times during the day [Johannesen et al, Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2016]. Dofetilide (Tikosyn, Pfizer, New York, NY) and mexiletine (Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, North Wales, PA) were administered orally immediately after meals, whereas lidocaine (B. Braun Medical, Bethlehem, PA), moxifloxacin and diltiazem were administered intravenously. Intravenous infusions were split into a 60-minute loading dose followed by a 30-minute maintenance dose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary pharmacokinetic samples were taken at the start and end of each of the three maintenance doses during the day (morning, afternoon and evening), as these were expected to be associated with highest plasma concentrations of both the oral and intravenously administered drugs. Additional pharmacokinetic samples were taken at 30 and 120 minutes poststart of intravenous dosing during each of the three dosing periods during the day. There was one week between treatment periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During each period, continuous ECGs were recorded at 500 Hz with an amplitude resolution of 2.5 &mu;V using the Mortara Surveyor system (Mortara, Milwaukee, WI). From the continuous recording, triplicate 10\u2010second ECGs were extracted before the draw of each pharmacokinetic sample at 14 predefined time\u2010points: 1 point pre-dose (-0.5 h) and 13 points post\u2010dose (1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5 and 24 h), during which the subjects were resting in a supine position for 10 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At each of the 14 time\u2010points, 3 optimal 10\u2010second 12\u2010lead ECGs were extracted with stable heart rates and maximum signal quality using Antares software (AMPS\u2010LLC, New York City, NY). The resulting ECGs were up\u2010sampled from 500 to 1000 Hz.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>raw</strong> directory contains the 4211 original extracted 10-second standard 12 lead ECG segments organized in subdirectories named after the subject number or randomization number <code>RANDID</code> in the second column of the <strong>SCR-003.Clinical.Data.csv</strong> file. The ECGs are stored in standard MIT format, with a signal <code>.dat</code> file and corresponding header <code>.hea</code> file for each segment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>medians</strong> directory contains derived representative median beats for the raw ECG segments. Median beats were obtained as follows: the median PQRST waveform (median cardiac beat) for each lead was calculated by sample-by-sample synchronization of the QRS complex, and beats of a nonsinus origin were excluded based on a cross-correlation coefficient and RR interval history [1].</p>\r\n<!--\r\nThe median beats are derived from the independent leads (I\u2010II, V1 to V6) of the 10\u2010second 12\u2010lead ECGs. In addition to the standard 12 lead ECG channels, the median beat files also contain derived vector magnitude leads and their constituents (vx, vy, vz) for a total of 16 channels.-->\r\n\r\n<p>There are also semi-automatic annotations of each median beat based on the vector magnitude lead, containing P onset, QRS onset, QRS offset, T peak, secondary T peak (if present) and T offset. The annotations are stored in standard MIT annotation format, with annotator extension <code>.atr</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>SCR-003.Clinical.Data.csv</strong> file contains demographic information about the subjects, and important metadata about each ECG recording including their time-point, dosing period, associated drug, various beat intervals, and morphology measurements. The spreadsheet column headings are described in the <strong>SCR-003.Clinical.Data.Description.txt</strong> file.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24336137\">Improving the assessment of heart toxicity for all new drugs through translational regulatory science</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Additional Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02308748\" target=\"_blank\">NCT02308748</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "full_description": "<h3><!-- added by KP, 12 June 2015 -->Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The STAFF III database was acquired during 1995&ndash;96 at Charleston Area Medical Center (WV, USA) where single prolonged balloon inflation had been introduced to achieve optimal results of percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography (PTCA) procedures, replacing the typical series of brief inflations. The lead investigator Dr. Stafford Warren designed the study protocol together with Dr. Galen Wagner at Duke University Medical Center (Durham, NC, USA); Dr. Michael Ringborn (Blekinge Hospital, Karlskrona, Sweden) was responsible for data acquisition. The database consists of ECG recordings from 104 patients, accounting for substantial inter-patient variability in reaction to prolonged balloon inflation as well as variability of heart rhythm and waveform morphology. Only patients receiving elective PTCA in one of the major coronary arteries were included. Patients suffering from ventricular tachycardia, undergoing an emergency procedure, or demonstrating signal loss during acquisition, were excluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The standard procedure was defined as follows. Pre-inflation (baseline) ECGs were acquired for 5 min at rest in supine position in either a relaxing room or the catheterization laboratory, or both, prior to any catheter insertion. Inflation ECGs were acquired up to five times in each patient. The mean inflation time was 4 min 23 s, ranging from 1 min 30 s to 9 min and 54 s. In 86 inflations, the balloon did not go up immediately at the beginning of the recording, but after 4 to 205 s into the recording. Moreover, in some cases, the balloon went down before the recording ended, with a postinflation period &gt;60 s in all but 11 inflations. All time instants related to balloon inflation/deflation were manually annotated. Post-inflation ECGs were acquired for 5 min at rest in supine position in either the catheterization laboratory or the relaxing room, or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The database contains a total of 152 occlusions in the major coronary arteries, distributed as 58 occlusions in left anterior descendent (LAD) artery, 59 in right coronary artery (RCA), 32 in left circumflex artery (LCX), and 3 in the left main (LM) artery. Based on ECG criteria, 35 patients had previous myocardial infarction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The database consists of standard 12-lead ECG data. Standard electrode placements were used for the precordial ECG leads, whereas the limb leads were obtained with the Mason&ndash;Likar electrode configuration to reduce noise originating from skeletal muscle. Data acquisition was based on custom-made equipment by Siemens&ndash;Elema AB (Solna, Sweden) with an extraordinary dynamic input amplitude range. The ECG was digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz and an amplitude resolution of 0.625 &micro;V. These specifications ensured that high-resolution digital signals could be produced which made it possible to analyze high-frequency components as well as other subtle electrophysiological phenomena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally, scntigraphic images were also obtained by injecting Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi for localizing the myocardium supplied by the temporarily occluded artery. However, these images have not come to play any significant role as they are only available for a small number of all patients, and therefore not provided for download on the PhysioNet website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dye injections during catheterization and angiography may case changes of the ECG morphology, and the injections are therefore annotated. However, not all injections were annotated, and therefore users are advised to be cautious when ECG changes are observed that mimic the dynamics commonly observed together with annotated injections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All clinical information and annotations are included in the xlsx and ods format spreadsheets, including columns which describe the measurement type correspond to each recording file. The event times related to the balloon inflation/deflation and the contrast injection are also provided as WFDB annotator files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each recording in the database is defined by the data files <strong>*.dat</strong> and <strong>*.hea</strong>, together with an annotation file <strong>*.event</strong> which states times for balloon inflation/deflation and contrast injection (only available for certain recordings).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comments on the original inflation annotations and the introduction of complementary information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In some files (marked in red in the spreadsheets), we identified additional inflations, not originally indicated in the original spreadsheet. This was done by checking the length of a recording vs the length of inflations; if these two numbers agreed, then we assumed that two or possibly more inflations occurred in the recording. This was the case for the following files: 7c, 11c, 39d, 53c, and 64b (2 inflations in total), and 39c (3 inflations). In addition, three recordings: 29c, 31c, and 77c, were already marked as having two inflations in the original spreadsheet. All of these extrapolated inflations are included in the <strong>.event</strong> annotation files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In file 27c (with inflation), the time until inflation was annotated. We then assumed that the remaining part was recorded during inflation. It may be the case that the balloon went down before the end of the recording, but this information is missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the second and the third inflation, if it exists, the annotated time until inflation (D0) is not strictly the time until inflation as D0 also includes the durations of previous pre-inflation(s), inflation(s), and post-inflation(s).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pablo Laguna, Leif S&ouml;rnmo, Juan Pablo Mart&iacute;nez, January 19, 2017.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its acquisition, the STAFF III Database has been distributed by Prof. Leif S&ouml;rnmo (Lund University, Sweden), responsible for the acquisition equipment and software.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Preterm Infant Cardio-respiratory Signals (PICS) database contains simultaneous ECG and respiration recordings of ten preterm infants collected from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the University of Massachusetts Memorial Healthcare. Statistical features based on linear estimates of heart rate are used to predict episodes of bradycardia.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten preterm infants were studied, with post-conceptional age of 29 3/7 to 34 2/7 weeks (mean: 31 1/7 weeks) and study weights of 843 to 2100 grams (mean: 1468 grams). The infants were spontaneously breathing room air and did not have any congenital or perinatal infection of the central nervous system, intraventricular hemorrhage of grade II or higher, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. A single channel of a 3-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal was recorded at 500 Hz (when available) from bedside patient monitors (Intellivue MP70, Philips Medical Systems) for ~20-70 hours per infant. In absence of an ECG channel, a compound ECG signal was recorded (250Hz). The compound ECG signal is an integrated signal of the three ECG lead channels. The choice of ECG availability was subject to nursing preference, and the researchers did not interfere with signals displayed on the Philips monitor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Respiratory signals, using external inductance bands placed around the chest wall and abdomen, were also recorded (50 Hz) and synchronized using VueLoggerTM , a data acquisition system developed at the Wyss Institute, Harvard University. See the referenced paper for more details.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The single channel ECG and Respiration records are provided in standard WFDB format. Recording start times are synchronized within each infant. ECGs are recorded at 500Hz except for infants 1 and 5, which are recorded as a compound ECG signal at 250Hz. The ECG leads are specified in the header files. R-peaks are extracted from the ECGs using a modified Pan-Tompkins algorithm. The annotations are then visually inspected by researchers to remove artifacts due to movement, disconnection, and any erroneous peak detections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Respiration signals are recorded at 50Hz from abdomen inductance bands, except for infant 1, which is recorded at 500Hz. The respiration signal for infant 1 was recorded using the respiration signal from the Philips monitor (i.e. abdomen inductance band information was not available at time of study). Respiration peaks are algorithmically extracted; however, these annotations have not been manually vetted yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bradycardia onset annotations are also provided. We define bradycardia as events where the heart rate slows to less than 100 bpm (or equivalently R-R &gt; 0.6 s) and for at least two beats (&gt; 1.2 s) in duration. We also consider bradycardia clustering (i.e. successive bradycardias after a leading bradycardia). For our study, we aggregate any bradycardia within a 3-minute window of a leading bradycardia into one bradycardia to avoid statistical distortions during the prediction phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECG and respiration records are named in the form: infant<strong>N</strong>_ecg and infant<strong>N</strong>_resp, where N is the infant number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annotation files as described in the previous section are also provided, with record names matching the records they are associated with. The annotation file extensions are qrsc for ECG R locations, resp for respiration peaks, and atr for bradycardia onset times.</p>",

The Tai Chi na&iuml;ve group included sixty healthy older participants, aged 50&ndash;79 years, living within the Greater Boston area, and reporting no regular Tai Chi practice within the past 5 years. Subjects were either randomized to 6 months of Tai Chi or usual care. Subjects came in for a baseline visit along with 3 month and 6 month follow-ups. The Tai Chi expert group consisted of twenty-seven healthy, older, aged 50-79 years, adults currently engaged in an active Tai Chi training regimen, each with at least 5 years of Tai Chi experience. The expert group was tested only at their baseline visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steady-state gait dynamics were assessed during over ground walking at preferred speed. Subjects walked along a long corridor (48m or 23m) that was wide enough (5m) to enable smooth turning. To record consecutive stride-to-stride durations, subjects had foot-switches (Mega Elektronika, Inc) inserted into their shoes, and the ME6000 data acquisition monitor attached to their waist. To collect the sufficient number of steps required for complexity measures, approximately 10 minutes of continuous walking was completed.

Audacity&reg; cross-platform audio software was used for recording and editing the signals on a PC. In total, 99 subjects had one signal recorded, three subjects had two and seven cases of twins were recorded individually, resulting in 119 total recordings. The average duration of each record is about 90 seconds. The sampling rate was generally 16,000 Hz with 16-bit quantization and a few recordings at 44,100 Hz. The data was recorded in wide-band mode of the digital stethoscope, with a frequency response of 20 Hz to 1 kHz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases (91 subjects), the heart sounds of the mothers were also recorded before each fetal PCG recording session. As a result, a total number of 92 maternal heart sounds data (90 subjects had one heart sound signal but one had two signals recorded) are also available in the dataset.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The record names are in the form fSS or mSS where f stands for fetal recording, m stands for maternal recording, and SS is the subject number.

    "full_description": "<!--refwrap-->\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The UniCA ElectroTastegram Database (PROP) contains 39 differential biopotential measurements recorded from the tongues of as many healthy voluntary human subjects (16 males, 23 females, equally divided into the three PROP taster status classes), during a stimulation with 30uL, 3.2 mmol/L solution of 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last decades, PROP tasting has gained considerable attention as a paradigmatic stimulus of general taste perception and oral marker for food preferences and eating behavior that ultimately impacts nutritional status and health. About 25%-30% of the Caucasian population does not perceive PROP taste (non-tasters), whereas the remaining does (tasters). Among the tasters, supertasters perceive PROP bitterness at levels far above the average (according to qualitative tests), whereas as their name suggests, medium tasters (MTs) occupy the middle ground between supertasters (STs) and non-tasters (NTs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In [1], a novel non-invasive technique for the direct measurement of the degree of activation of peripheral taste function in humans through electrophysiological recordings was presented and used to study the relationship between amplitude and rate of the biopotential evoked by the PROP stimulus and subjects&#39; PROP genotype and phenotype. Based on the evidence of such a seminal work, [2] addressed for the first time the problem of evaluating the effectiveness and limitations of supervised classifiers in the automatic identification of PROP taster categories: NT, ST, MT. This dataset presents all the biopotentials used in that work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This data set consists of 39 differential biopotential measurements recorded from the tongues of as many healthy voluntary human subjects (16 males, 23 females, equally divided into the three PROP taster status classes), during a stimulation with 30uL, 3.2 mmol/L solution of 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The depolarization measurement after the application of PROP stimulus to the tongue was performed by using a custom comformable electrode in contact with the dorsal surface of the tongue, and a second electrode, consisting simply of a silver wire rolled into a ball, placed on the ventral side of the tongue as a second terminal for the differential measurement. A ground disposable gelled electrode was applied on the cheek. The recording device was a 32-channel Porti7 portable physiological measurement system (TMSI, The Netherlands), the electrodes were connected to the signal terminals of the AUX channels, featuring a dynamic range (&plusmn;3 V) that is broader than the standard bipolar ExG channels (150 mV) in order to prevent saturation of the analog amplifier. The positive and negative inputs of the AUX channel were connected to the electrode on the dorsal and ventral sides of the tongue, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The analog signals were sampled at fs = 2048 Hz and digitized at 22 bits (1.43 uV resolution). At this sampling frequency, the actual bandwidth was limited by a digital decimation filter with a cut-off of approximately 550 Hz. The signals in this dataset present the same duration (26 s), and are recorded from about 6 seconds before the application of the stimulus to about 20 seconds from it. Due to the smooth trend of the depolarization, all signals were filtered with a low-pass equiripple finite impulse response (FIR) filter, with a cut-off frequency of 6 Hz (86th order). The samples values reflect an amplitude in mV. The file &quot;info.txt&quot; reports the PROP taster categories (NT, ST, MT) for the signals in the dataset (ordered). Each header file reports the subject&#39;s gender and PROP taster category.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Files have been converted to WFDB format by the mat2wfdb Matlab function, with automatic parameters setup, and can be easily read by using the rdsamp function.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Danilo Pani, Ilenia Usai, Piero Cosseddu, Luigi Raffo, Annalisa Bonfiglio (Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Italy) and Melania Melis, Giorgia Sollai, Roberto Crnjar, Iole Tomassini Barbarossa (Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Cagliari, Italy).</p>",

    "full_description": "<h3>Abstract</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Evoked Auditory Responses in Hearing Impaired database contains evoked Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) and Otoacoustic Emission (OAE) recordings in eight hearing impaired listeners, in response to tone-burst stimuli across a wide range of levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Eight listeners (four females, four males, ages 40 to 85), with a known history of hearing impairment confirmed through clinical tests (audiometric measurements made in the Northeastern University Speech-Language, and Hearing Center), and thresholds higher than 25&thinsp;dB HL (at least one octave frequency between 250&thinsp;Hz to 8&thinsp;kHz), participated in all measurements. Listeners were tested on the ear that had the best (lowest) thresholds determined through a 2-interval, 2-alternative forced-choice procedure with the exact stimuli used throughout the experiment. This choice of ear was made to ensure that measurements could be made over the maximum physical and perceptual stimulus ranges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three listeners were tested on the left ear and five listeners were tested on the right ear. Three listeners could not be tested at 4&thinsp;kHz because their thresholds were higher than 85&thinsp;dB peak-equivalent sound pressure level (peSPL).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tone bursts used were 1-kHz tones with 4&thinsp;ms duration and 4-kHz tones with 1&thinsp;ms duration. The stimuli were multiplied with a Gaussian window and then end-padded with silence to generate a stimulus length of 41.7&thinsp;ms. The Gaussian window was generated through the MATLAB function GAUSSWIN, which resulted in attenuations of about 27&thinsp;dB at the start (0) and end times (1 or 4&thinsp;ms) of the tone burst. The lack of a steady-state region in the window (i.e., no plateau) helped ensure consistent root mean square (RMS) values, equal spectral dispersion on a logarithmic scale, and a good TBABR response to transient stimuli. The stimulus levels varied from 5&thinsp;dB below the listener&rsquo;s threshold to 100&thinsp;dB peSPL in steps of 5&thinsp;dB. Levels matched the specifications of the voltage-to-level conversion provided by Etymotic Research for the ER-10C apparatus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stimuli were generated in MATLAB (2006b running on Ubuntu) and converted from digital (48-kHz sampling frequency) to analog using a 24-bit Lynx Two sound card. The analog signal was then passed through a Tucker-Davis Technologies HB7 headphone buffer and presented monaurally via the two transducers of the Etymotic ER-10C to a listener inside a double-walled sound-attenuating booth. During the TBOAE and TBABR measurements, the recordings from the ER-10C were converted from analog to digital (48&thinsp;kHz sampling frequency) via a Lynx Two sound card. Routine calibration for each system was performed to test for proper wiring and ER-10C output in a plastic syringe coupler provided by Etymotic. All levels were determined using RMS of the windowed signal relative to the specifications which were provided by Etymotic and verified by doing an actual in ear measurement for a single listener using a Fonix 6500-CX real-ear system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The data files are provided in standard WFDB format, named: h<strong>A</strong>_<strong>B</strong>_<strong>C</strong>kHz_<strong>D</strong>_<strong>E</strong> - where <strong>A</strong> is the subject number, <strong>B</strong> is the ear used, <strong>C</strong> is the stimulus frequency, <strong>D</strong> is the stimulus level in dB SPL, and <strong>E</strong> is the trial number of the given stimulus level and frequency.

    "full_description": "<h3>Abstract</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database contains one hour oxygen saturation measurements of 36 patients, used for the analysis of oxygen saturation variability.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pulse oximetry is routinely used for monitoring patients&#39; oxygen saturation levels with little regard to the variability of this physiological variable. There are few published studies on oxygen saturation variability (OSV), with none describing the variability and its pattern in a healthy adult population. The aim of this study was to characterise the pattern of OSV using several parameters: the regularity (sample entropy analysis), the self-similarity (detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)), and the complexity (multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis). Secondly, to determine if there were any changes that occur with age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study population consisted of 36 individuals. The &#39;young&#39; population consisted of 20 individuals [Mean age = 21.0 (SD = 1.36 years)] and the &#39;old&#39; population consisted of 16 individuals [Mean age = 50.0 (SD = 10.4 years)]. Through DFA analysis, OSV was shown to exhibit fractal-like patterns. The sample entropy revealed the variability to be more regular than heart rate variability and respiratory rate variability. There was a significant inverse correlation between mean oxygen saturation and sample entropy in healthy individuals. Additionally, the MSE analysis described a complex fluctuation pattern, which was reduced with age (p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest partial &quot;uncoupling&quot; of the cardio-respiratory control system that occurs with ageing. Overall, this study has characterized OSV using pre-existing tools. We have showed that entropy analysis of pulse oximetry signals carries information about body oxygenation. This may have the potential to be used in clinical practice to detect differences in diseased patient subsets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before starting the recording, the participants are interviewed to obtain:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Age</li>\r\n\t<li>BMI (use their weight and height on the NHS BMI calculator tool)</li>\r\n\t<li>Gender</li>\r\n\t<li>Smoking history and/or current smoking status</li>\r\n\t<li>Any significant medical conditions that could affect reading</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Measurement Setup:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>In the LabChart software, switch off all input sources except input 1,2, and 3.</li>\r\n\t<li>Set the sampling frequency to 1KHz.</li>\r\n\t<li>Plug Pulse Oximeter into Power Lab input 1.</li>\r\n\t<li>Plug the Pulse pressure transducer into Power Lab input 2.</li>\r\n\t<li>Attach Respiratory band into Power Lab input 3.</li>\r\n\t<li>Connect personal computer to the PowerLab data acquisition system.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Procedure for recording:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Clean the pulse oximeter and place on finger of participants choosing</li>\r\n\t<li>Place the pulse pressure transducer on the adjacent finger</li>\r\n\t<li>Wrap the Respiratory band around the umbilicus of the participant</li>\r\n\t<li>Preferably have participant sitting with the fingers relatively still</li>\r\n\t<li>Test equipment to ensure correct readings</li>\r\n\t<li>Once the equipment has been checked stop the test and start the official recording</li>\r\n\t<li>Add a comment to show when the data collection has started and once again when it has ended</li>\r\n\t<li>After the hour has passed stop the recording, then remove and clean the equipment</li>\r\n\t<li>Save the file ensuring complete anonymity by using the date of collection (i.e if 1st participant on January 1st 2017, then save file as 010117A)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Extracting Oxygen Saturation Data for Analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Select the 1 hour recorded segment</li>\r\n\t<li>File &gt; Export As &ndash; select LabChart Text FIle</li>\r\n\t<li>Choose channel 1 and select the option for current selection</li>\r\n\t<li>Down sample by 1000 and remove comments</li>\r\n\t<li>Save file in a separate file with the other samples</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The oxygen saturation data files are provided in standard WFDB format.

    "full_description": "<h3>Abstract</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database contains wrist PPGs recorded during walking, running and bike riding. Simultaneous motion estimates are collected using both accelerometers and gyroscopes to give multiple options for the removal of motion interference from the PPG traces. A reference chest ECG is included to allow a gold-standard comparison of heart rate during exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Experimental Protocol</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Measurements were taken using an ECG unit placed on the chest together with a PPG and Inertial Measurement Unit placed on the left wrist while participants used an indoor treadmill and exercise bike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Single channel, two electrode, ECG recordings were taken using an Actiwave (CamNtech, Cambridge, UK) recorder and pre-gelled self-adhesive Silver-Silver Chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes as are standard for ECG monitoring. These were placed on the upper chest with one electrode on either side of the heart. R peaks in this ECG trace were identified by hand and these times are included in the database to allow a gold standard reference heart rate comparison. These R peak times are referenced assuming the first sample in the ECG trace occurs at time 0 s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PPG and motion data were recorded using a Shimmer 3 GSR+ unit (Shimmer Sensing, Dublin, Ireland). This contains a gyroscope, a low noise accelerometer, a wide range accelerometer, and a magnetometer integrated into a single package. The PPG sensor was glued to the main Shimmer unit in order to give a rigid connection and allow the movement sensors inside the main Shimmer unit to accurately record the movement of the PPG sensor. The combined unit was then placed on the left wrist in approximately the position of a standard watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants were asked to perform one or more different types of exercise. Four options were available:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>walking on a treadmill at a normal pace for up to 10 minutes.</li>\r\n\t<li>light jog/run on a treadmill, at a pace set by the participant, for up to 10 minutes.</li>\r\n\t<li>pedal on an exercise bike set a low resistance for up to 10 minutes.</li>\r\n\t<li>pedal on an exercise bike set at a higher resistance for up to 10 minutes.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The objective was to introduce a range of representative motion artifacts into the collected heart signals, not to carry out a set exercise routine. As such each participant was free to set the pace of the treadmill and pedal rate on the bike so they were comfortable and also to change these settings or stop the exercise at any time. Most participants spent between 4 and 6 minutes on each activity. In all cases the subject was starting from rest. All signals were sampled at 256 Hz. Records from 8 participants are present (3 male, 5 female), aged 22--32 (mean 26.5).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the walking and running records, the database contains the raw PPG and motion signals present after segmentation into the appropriate activity. No filtering is applied, beyond that built in to the Shimmer hardware. For the cycling records, large amounts of high frequency noise were present in the PPG traces. Prior to conversion to WFDB format the cycling PPG traces were low pass filtered using a second order IIR Butterworth digital filter with 15~Hz cut-off and zero group delay with the Matlab filtfilt command. All ECG records have a 50 Hz notch filter applied as part of the Actiwave control software to remove mains interference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further details and illustrative example signals can be found in the reference paper</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>PPG, motion, and ecg recordings are provided in WFDB format, with record names reflecting the subject number and the activity. WFDB annotation files of the reference ECG r-peaks are also provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This data was contributed to PhysioNet by Alexander J Casson from the University of Manchester, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.</p>",

All diagnoses were made according to indications of the SIFEL protocol, a clinical protocol compiled by the Italian Society of Phoniatrics and Logopaedics. The database includes information such as gender, age, pathology, lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol and coffee consummation), occupational status, and the results of two specific medical questionnaires: the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The medical phonatric examinations, the voice signal acquisitions, and the completion of the medical questionnaires were performed at the ambulatories of Phoniatrics and Videolaryngoscopy of the Hospital University of Naples &quot;Federico II&quot;, or at the medical room of the &quot;Institute of High Performance Computing and Networking (ICAR-CNR)&quot;. The study started on May 16, 2016 and ended on May 15, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The acquired signals consists of a recording of a vocalization of the vowel &#39;a&#39; five seconds in length without any interruption of sound. All samples were recorded in a quiet (&lt; 30 dB of background noise) and not too dry (humidity greater than 30-40%) room. The voice recordings were made using an appropriate m-health system, Vox4Health, able to acquire in real time the voice signal by using the microphone of a mobile device. This system was installed on a Samsung Galaxy S4, Android version 5.0.1. It was held at a distance of about 20 cm from the patient at an angle of about 45 degrees. All recordings were sampled at 8000 Hz and their resolution was 32-bit. Additionally, each recording was filltered with an appropriate filter to remove any noise accidentally added during the acquisition. The participants were instructed to articulate the vocal sample, with a constant voice intensity, as they would during a normal conversation. For each subject certain training tests were performed about two/three times before the recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subjects involved in the study had to be adults aged between 18 and 70 years and able to follow several phases expected in the process.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Modulation of plantar pressure and muscle during gait was acquired to investigate the influences of electrical stimulation (ES) of the tibialis anterior (TA) on plantar pressure and the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) activity during gait in healthy adults. The database consists of plantar pressure distribution and two muscles activity during gait from 20 healthy male adults. We evaluated the activities of gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis during gait in the preliminary study, and observed that gastrocnemius medialis is more sensitive to gait. Therefore, we recorded GM and TA in this study. Only subjects who do not have any history of either neurological or orthopedic impairments were included..</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The study procedure was as follows. All subjects were instructed to refrain from alcohol and strenuous activity for 24 hours prior to the experiments. ES was applied to the TA of the subjects for 30 minutes, while they were positioned sitting on the bed. First, we applied passive force until firm resistance to further movement was encountered, and then we measured ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) with knee full extension and 90&deg; flexion using a hand-held goniometer. We measured the ankle dorsiflexion ROM, and subjects were directed to walk 10 m four times at a comfortable speed to measure plantar pressure and muscle activity during gait before and after ES. The ES procedure was as follows. Subjects&#39; TAs were stimulated using an electrical stimulation device (ES-360, ITO CO., Tokyo, Japan) set at 50 Hz with pulse duration of 300 &mu;sec. Stimulating electrodes (PALS Platinum M size, each about 5 cm long by 5 cm wide; Axelgaard Manufacturing Co., Fallbrook, CA, USA) were placed proximally and distally over the motor point of the TA muscles. In addition, we measured the dorsiflexion ROM per five minutes during ES, and regulated the stimulus intensity to keep the angle within -5&deg; from the maximum dorsiflexion ROM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plantar pressure data consist of peak plantar pressure (PP) and pressure time integral (PTI). PP and PTI were recorded as follows. Plantar pressure distribution was recorded using an F-scan in-shoe pressure measurement system (NITTA Co., Osaka, Japan) at 50 Hz during gait. We fixed sensor seats on the subjects&rsquo; plantar surfaces using extensibility tape and socks to minimize the slip of sensor. Calibration was performed using the patient&#39;s body weight, and with one leg standing on the sensor. According to the method of Sartor et al.[2], the plantar surface was divided into three areas: the rear foot, midfoot, and forefoot. PP and PTI were calculated for four areas (rear foot, midfoot, forefoot and total plantar surface).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The muscle activities during gait were recorded as electromyography (EMG). The recording procedure was as follows. EMG activities were recorded from the right GM and TA using a two-channel data logger (Feedback Logger, DKH, Tokyo, Japan) and surface EMG sensor (SX230-1000, Biometrics Ltd, Newport., UK) at 1,000 Hz. The surface EMG sensors were placed according to the method that the SENIAM (Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles) project recommends. The load switch system was attached on the heel as a foot switch for determining heel strike (HS), and the signals from the load switch system and F-scan system at HS had to be synchronized between plantar pressure data and EMG data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the method of Nagai et al.[1], the EMG activities from GM and TA during maximum isometric contraction were recorded via maximum isometric dorsiflexion of the ankle with the subject sitting on the chair and maximum isometric plantar flexion with the patient in single leg stance, respectively. From these, we calculated the integrated electromyogram (IEMG). Root mean square (RMS) using a 50-msec window was calculated during stance phase of the gait cycle. Muscle activity onset, duration and cessation were determined using the threshold of 10% of maximum amplitude per gait cycle, which can detect the small activity of muscles during gait, excluding the artifact of baseline. Active time, onset time, peak time and cessation time were determined based on RMS wave. IEMG was shown as a percentage of the IEMG at maximum isometric contraction (%IEMG). Onset time, peak time, active time, and cessation time were reported separately as a percentage of the stance time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Each data is identified by the name of the data (P; plantar pressure, E; EMG) followed by an arbitrary ID number and the name of trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the plantar pressure (P_) files, the contents are: in column 1, Start (the moment at which any sensor in each foot area reacted). In column 2, End (the moment all sensors that were detecting pressure in each foot area ceased to). In column 3, Contact duration (the duration from start to end). In column 4, Peak pressure. In column 5, Pressure time integral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the EMG (E_) files, the contents are: in column 1, Time (Time series). In column 2, Tibialis anterior (the raw data of TA during 1 trial of 10 m walking). In column 3, Gastrocnemius medialis (the raw data of TA during 1 trial of 10 m walking).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A separate file (Summary sheet.txt) includes clinical information for each subject, including age, gender, height, weight and gait parameters (walking speed, number of steps, stride length, time of stance-phase and time of swing-phase).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Nagai K, Yamada M, Uemura K, Mori S, Aoyama T, Ichihashi N, et al.

The main objective of the dataset is to provide a set of annotated contraction intervals (annotated intervals related to uterine contractions), and another set of annotated non-contraction intervals (dummy intervals, i.e., intervals out of uterine contractions). The annotated contraction and dummy intervals of the records allow:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>characterization of uterine records, contraction intervals, and dummy intervals during pregnancy;</li>\r\n\t<li>development of algorithms to classify between preterm and term uterine records, and/or, between labor and nonlabor uterine records.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The dataset was developed at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science (Laboratory for Biomedical Computer Systems and Imaging), University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, while the records were collected at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. (Obtaining of the uterine records and the research were approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of the Republic Slovenia: No. 32/01/97 and No. 108/09/09. The recording protocol (including position of the electrodes) was those which was also used during collecting the records of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/tpehgdb/\" target=\"other\"> Term-Preterm EHG Database (TPEHG DB)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The women participating in the study represented a sample of the general population. The TPEHGT DS contains 31 uterine records of which:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>13 preterm records are with spontaneous delivery (eight pregnancies), the mean delivery time was 33.7 (&plusmn; 1.97) weeks, and contain 47 annotated contraction intervals and 47 annotated dummy intervals;</li>\r\n\t<li>13 term records are with spontaneous delivery (ten pregnancies), the mean delivery time was 38.1 (&plusmn; 1.04) weeks, and contain 53 annotated contraction intervals and 53 annotated dummy intervals;</li>\r\n\t<li>five records are from non-pregnant women, and contain 53 annotated dummy intervals.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The records of pregnant women were obtained during regular check-ups in pregnancy around 31st week of pregnancy. The mean recording time and standard deviation of the records of pregnant women was 30.2 (&plusmn; 2.76) weeks of pregnancy. For the manual annotating procedure, we used a graphic user interface and annotation editor. Besides visualizing original signals and annotation editing, the graphic user interface also allows calculating, and visualizing, spectra and spectrograms of the signals. Consensus about the annotated intervals was reached by two annotators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EHG signals of the records were collected from the abdominal surface. The electrodes (AgCl2) to measure EHG signals of the records were placed in two horizontal rows, symmetrically above and under the navel, spaced 7 cm apart:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>the first electrode (E1) was placed 3.5 cm to the left and 3.5 cm above the navel;</li>\r\n\t<li>the second electrode (E2) was placed 3.5 cm to the right and 3.5 cm above the navel;</li>\r\n\t<li>the third electrode (E3) was placed 3.5 cm to the right and 3.5 cm below the navel;</li>\r\n\t<li>the fourth electrode (E4) was placed 3.5 cm to the left and 3.5 cm below the navel;</li>\r\n\t<li><em>the reference electrode was attached to the woman&rsquo;s thigh</em>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The differences in the electrical potentials of the electrodes were recorded, producing three signals:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>S1 = E2 - E1 (first EHG signal);</li>\r\n\t<li>S2 = E2 - E3 (second EHG signal);</li>\r\n\t<li>S3 = E4 - E3 (third EHG signal).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to sampling, the EHG signals were filtered using an analog three-pole Butterworth filter with the bandwidth from 0.0 Hz to 5.0 Hz. The fourth simultaneous signal was the analog signal corresponding to an external tocogram (TOCO signal) measuring mechanical uterine pressure acquired using a cardiotocograph (model HP8030) attached at the top of the fundus. The analog TOCO signal was lead to one of the amplifiers of the A/D converter (the value of 150 &mu;V corresponds to a pressure of 1 Pa). The sampling frequency for the EHG and TOCO signals was 20 samples per second per signal, with 16-bit resolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original EHG and TOCO signals of the records were further filtered using the four-pole band-pass digital Butterworth filter with cut-off frequencies at 0.08 Hz and 5.0 Hz applied bi-directionally.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Complex Upper-Limb Movements database contains hand trajectory data collected from ten subjects as they performed various upper-limb motor tasks. The data was used in the above-referenced manuscript to identify the motor primitives contributing to the observed motor patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The hand trajectory of motion during the performance of one-dimensional point-to-point movements has been shown to be marked by motor primitives with a bell-shaped velocity profile. Researchers have investigated if motor primitives with the same shape mark also complex upper-limb movements. They have done so by analyzing the magnitude of the hand trajectory velocity vector. This approach has failed to identify motor primitives with a bell-shaped velocity profile as the basic elements underlying the generation of complex upper-limb movements. In this study, we examined upper-limb movements by analyzing instead the movement components defined according to a Cartesian coordinate system with axes oriented in the medio-lateral, antero-posterior, and vertical directions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten healthy subjects (7 males; 26.4&plusmn;4.52 years of age; 9 right-handed) with no known neurological or orthopedic conditions affecting the control of motion were recruited to participate in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. The dataset was collected in the Motion Analysis Lab (<a href=\"http://srh-mal.net/\">http://srh-mal.net/</a>) at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To explore the validity of the theoretical model proposed in the above-referenced manuscript, we asked a group of ten healthy subjects to perform a battery of upper-limb motor tasks. Data collected using a camera-based motion capture system (VICON, Oxford UK) was preprocessed using the system&rsquo;s software to reconstruct the three-dimensional position of a reflective marker representing the hand trajectory of motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The csv data files contain four columns. The data in the first column is the time axis in seconds. The data samples in the other three columns are the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of the reflective marker utilized in each experiment to represent the hand trajectory of movement. The data is reported in meters. Different files contain data pertaining to different subjects for different motor tasks.

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This database contains multimodal data from a large study investigating the effects of ischemic stroke on cerebral vasoregulation. The cross sectional study compared 60 subjects who suffered strokes, to 60 control subjects, collecting the following data for each patient across multiple days: transcranial doppler of cerebral arteries, 24-h blood pressure numerics, high resolution waveforms (ECG, blood pressure, CO2 and respiration) during various movement tasks, 24-h ECG, EMG, and accelerometer recordings, and gait pressure recordings during a walking test.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Functional recovery after stroke depends upon integrity of cerebral vasoregulation. This project tested 3 hypotheses:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Older adults with ischemic stroke have impaired cerebral vasoregulation, rendering cerebral blood flow dependent on blood pressure.</li>\r\n\t<li>Autonomic blood pressure control is impaired after stroke. Activities of daily living may induce hypotension, posing a risk of hypoperfusion.</li>\r\n\t<li>The distribution of impaired vasoreactivity extends beyond the infarct region into surrounding gray and white matter, affecting other vascular territories.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>We investigated cerebral vasoregulation using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound and arterial spin labeling MRI at 3 Tesla, to determine the impact of stroke on cerebral blood flow regulation, autonomic 24 blood pressure control, postural control and cognition during daily living activities in older adults with and without minor stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>full-study-protocol.docx</strong> file contains a writeup of the full experimental protocol.

To assess baroreflex function in human subjects, two complementary methods to simulate the response in heart rate elicited by the Valsalva maneuver were developed and applied to data obtained from a cohort of healthy normal volunteers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data Collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Data was obtained from 27 participants excluding individuals with histories positive for inherited cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, aneurism, dissection, vascular surgery, pulmonary hypertension, connective tissue disease, or stroke. For each such normal healthy subject, baseline blood pressures were measured at 200 Hz during normal respiration prior to one or more instances of a forced expiration into a closed glottis (i.e Valsalva maneuver). The airway pressures achieved during expiration were measured at 10 Hz, with subjects instructed to maintain a pressure exceeding 30 mmHg for at least 10 seconds, though review of the data will show variability in each participant&#39;s results. Data collection of both blood and airway pressures continues throughout a recovery period subsequent to each Valsalva maneuver.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The data for 27 subjects are presented here where for a given subject (e.g. norm001) two simultaneous recordings have been made. One is for the blood pressure obtained with a Finapres blood pressure monitor (e.g. norm001_BP) and the other is the thoracic pressure during three Valsalva maneuvers (e.g norm001_P). The thoracic pressure is measured by the subject breathing into a small closed chamber instrumented to measure the chamber pressure.

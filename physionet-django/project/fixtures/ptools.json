The package is written in highly portable C and can be used on all popular platforms, including GNU/Linux, MacOS X, MS-Windows, and all versions of Unix.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>WFDB library</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb/lib/\">set of functions</a> (subroutines) for reading and writing files in the formats used by PhysioBank databases (among others). The WFDB library is <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb/lib/COPYING.LIB\">LGPL</a>ed, and can be used by programs written in ANSI/ISO C, K&amp;R C, C++, or Fortran, running under any operating system for which an ANSI/ISO or K&amp;R C compiler is available, including all versions of Unix, MS-DOS, MS-Windows, the Macintosh OS, and VMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Optionally, the WFDB library may be compiled with support for reading input directly from web (HTTP) and FTP servers without the use of a web browser or an FTP client. This optional feature allows applications linked with the WFDB library to view or analyze data such as those available from <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/\">PhysioBank</a> without the need to download entire records and to store them locally. To enable this feature, you will also need the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/libcurl/\"><code>libcurl</code></a> library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WFDB library is documented by the <em>WFDB Programmer&#39;s Guide</em> (available as <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wpg/wpg.htm\">HTML</a> or <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wpg/wpg.pdf\">PDF</a>).

    "full_description": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>SEMIA, version 3.0.1, is a tool for viewing time series of diagnostic and morphology parameters of long-term ambulatory recordings, and ST segment annotations with their corresponding ECG waveforms of the Long-Term ST Database (LTST DB). SEMIA was created during the development of the LTST DB, a project supported by Medtronic, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Zymed, Inc. (Camarillo, CA, USA).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Compiling SEMIA</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have not already installed the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB software package</a> and the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/xview/\">XView toolkit</a>, do so now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are running under GNU/Linux, you may not need to compile SEMIA. Try running the precompiled version of SEMIA available <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/semia/semia\">here</a>. (You will still need to have installed WFDB and XView in order to do this successfully.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need to compile SEMIA, make a directory for the SEMIA sources, then copy all files from this directory into it. (For convenience, you may download this <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ltstdb/semia-3.0.1.tar.gz\">gzip-compressed tar archive</a> of all files in this directory rather than downloading the individual files.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enter your directory of SEMIA sources and type &#39;make&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may encounter many warnings related to improperly formatted comments in XView #include files. These warnings may be ignored. If you wish to eliminate them, download and apply this <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb/wave/xview-patches\">patch</a> (read and follow the instructions at the beginning of the patch to see how to apply it).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When &#39;make&#39; finishes, copy semia into a directory in your <strong>PATH</strong>, and copy semia.opt and semia.hlp into the directory where you wish to use SEMIA.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Using SEMIA</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To run SEMIA successfully, the following files of the LTST DB are needed in the current working directory:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>s<em>nnnnn</em>.hea (the header file for record s<em>nnnnn</em>). This file also contains comments of human annotators, diagnostic data of the patient, and technical data of the record.</li>\r\n\t<li>s<em>nnnnn</em>.dat (digitized ECGs for the record)</li>\r\n\t<li>s<em>nnnnn</em>.cnt (numbers of annotated ST events and their durations according to annotation protocols A, B, and C, and numbers of normal and abnormal heart beats)</li>\r\n\t<li>s<em>nnnnn</em>_fin.dmy (time series of &quot;fine&quot; diagnostic and morphology parameters obtained on average heart beats)</li>\r\n\t<li>s<em>nnnnn</em>_raw.dmy (time series of &quot;raw&quot; (resampled - 0.5 samples/sec - and smoothed) diagnostic and morphology parameters)</li>\r\n\t<li>s<em>nnnnn</em>_1.sta (ST annotation markers according to annotation protocol A)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The last three of these files are contained within the .tsr.zip files in the LTST DB directory on PhysioNet (or on the &quot;Subset&quot; CD-ROM). Download the .tsr.zip file and unpack it using a command such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>unzip s20011.tsr.zip</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, you will need copies of semia.opt (a text file containing SEMIA&#39;s options) and semia.hlp (a text file containing on-line help for SEMIA) in the current working directory, as noted above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Run SEMIA by typing &quot;semia&quot;. Click on the &quot;Help&quot; button to view SEMIA&#39;s on-line manual. To open a record, click on &quot;Open&quot;, then enter the record name (s<em>nnnnn</em> only; do not include .hea or any other suffix in the record name). Depending on the speed of your system, it may take up to a minute for SEMIA to load the data after you click &quot;OK&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the data have been loaded, several buttons that were initially inactive become available for use. Each of them ( &quot;Lead0&quot;, &quot;Lead1&quot;, &quot;Lead2&quot;, &quot;Data&quot;, and &quot;KL&quot;) opens a window when clicked. (&quot;Lead2&quot; remains inactive unless you have opened a record with 3 ECG signals.)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The &quot;Lead&quot; windows display time series of diagnostic parameters (raw and fine ST level functions, raw and fine ST slope functions, raw linearly interpolated ST reference functions, raw ST deviation functions, raw and fine heart rate functions, and annotated ST episodes) and ST segment annotations according to annotation protocol A of the LTST DB.\r\n\t<p>Fine time series or functions are those obtained on average heart beats after noise detection during preprocessing phase. Raw time series or functions are those after resampling and smoothing of fine functions.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>ST segment annotations are: global reference, local references that define the ST reference function, ST segment annotations indicating ischemic and heart-rate related ST episodes (beginnings, extrema, ends), axis shift annotations, conduction change annotations, noise annotations, and annotations indicating unreadable intervals (beginnings, ends).</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Three different display modes for &quot;Lead&quot; windows are possible:</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Unsubtracted mode displaying ST level function (linearly interpolated ST reference function is not subtracted from the ST level function). In this mode, the active reference to compare ST segment waveforms is the global reference annotation.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Unsubtracted mode displaying ST level function (linearly interpolated ST reference function is not subtracted from the ST level function). In this mode, the active reference to compare ST segment waveforms is a local reference annotation.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Subtracted mode displaying ST deviation function (linearly interpolated ST reference function is subtracted from the ST level function to form the ST deviation function). In this mode, the active reference to compare ST segment waveforms is the global reference annotation</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<p>The ECG signal corresponding to current active reference annotation is displayed in the upper part of the &quot;Data&quot; window.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Time series displayed in the &quot;Lead&quot; windows can be examined by pointing them using mouse cursor or setting the <strong>Marker</strong> at the time instance of interest. The corresponding ECG signal is displayed in the lower part of the &quot;Data&quot; window.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>ST segment annotations can be examined using the <strong>Exm</strong> option. The examined ST annotation becomes the currently active annotation, and its corresponding ECG signal is displayed in the lower part of the &quot;Data&quot; window as well.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>The time scale may be adjusted to permit between 1 minute and 96 hours of data to be seen at once. Time series from &quot;other&quot; ECG leads may be overlaid in each &quot;Lead&quot; window.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>The &quot;Data&quot; window displays the ECG signal corresponding to the time of the active reference annotation in the upper portion of the window, and that corresponding to the time of the current active annotation or marker in the lower portion of the window. These two ECG waveforms may be overlaid. A variety of scales may be selected for comparing ST segment morphologies. The time scale may be adjusted to permit between 1 and 60 seconds of data to be seen at once.\r\n\t<p>The center heart beat in each ECG trace is the beat average over the chosen time window. ECG signals from &quot;other&quot; ECG leads may be overlaid.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>The &quot;KL&quot; window displays time series of morphology (waveform shape) parameters. Two sets of parameters (for the ST segment and the QRS complex) can be displayed; the parameters are coefficients of a Karhunen-Lo&egrave;ve transform (principal components).\r\n\t<p>The ST segment or QRS complex distance function (Mahalanobis distance function) can be overlaid in the KL window.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Franc Jager, George B.

Both windows are shifted to the right by the shift s. Adapted from (1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At each step, a normalized histogram of the data points in the memory window is computed. Then, the interval [0,1] is divided into c adjacent intervals, and each interval is assigned a color. If the jet color-map is used, the interval [0,1/c) corresponds to dark red and the interval ((c-1)/c,1] corresponds to dark blue. Subsequently, each data point in the colorization window is assigned the color of the histogram bin into which it falls. Finally, the colorization window is advanced by the shift, s, and the memory window is either extended or advanced by the same amount (Fig. 2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 2 shows: Schematic illustration of the colorization algorithm: the histogram of the time series (left panel) is colorized according to the bins height.

Depending on whether the symbol LOCAL is defined at compilation time, PBI_URL is either</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n/home/physionet/html/physiobank/database/physiobank-index\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>or</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nhttp://physionet.org/physiobank/database/physiobank-index\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In normal operation, the Index is read only once and is then kept in memory, so although startup time may be longer if LOCAL was not defined and the Index is read via the network, the time needed to respond to a query is unaffected by this choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted above, <strong>pbsqs</strong> and <strong>pbsqsd</strong> interpret and execute so-called <em>simple queries</em>. Simple queries include a subject (a class of data), a relationship (e.g., equal to, greater than, etc.), and a value (a string or numeric pattern to be compared with the subject elements). For more on simple queries, see the help for <strong>pbsqs</strong> (pbsqs-help.txt) or <strong>pbsearch</strong> (help.html).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>pbsqsc</strong> is a very simple Perl script (only 17 lines of code, plus comments) that can act as a client for <strong>pbsqsd</strong>. As written, <strong>pbsqsc</strong> and <strong>pbsqsd</strong> must run on the same machine, but this restriction can easily be removed by replacing localhost in <strong>pbsqsc</strong> with the hostname of the machine that is running <strong>pbsqsd</strong>. To use <strong>pbsqsc</strong>, enter a simple query in the command line, like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\npbsqsc &#39;age &gt;= 85&#39;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Note the use of quotation marks to protect characters such as &#39;&gt;&#39; from the shell. The results of the query appear on the standard output; in most cases, you will want to capture the output in a file, or redirect it into a pipe, as in these examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\npbsqsc &#39;ecg-3 ~ 24:0:0&#39; &gt;24-hour-ecgs\r\npbsqsc &#39;age = 0&#39; | more\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The first of these uses the &#39;~&#39; (&quot;similar&quot;) comparison to select records containing 3 or more ECG signals, at least 24 hours in duration, and to save the list of results in a file named &#39;24-hour-ecgs&#39;. The second selects records of infants and passes the results to <strong>more</strong>, which displays them a page at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>pbsearch</strong> is a CGI perl script intended to be run by a web server, so that you can interact with it using your web browser. Go to <a href=\"http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/pbsearch\">http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/pbsearch</a> to try it out. As for <strong>pbsqsc</strong>, it must run on the same machine as <strong>pbsqsd</strong> unless you edit it to replace localhost. Unlike <strong>pbsqsc</strong>, however, you can feed results of simple query searches to the plugins to answer more complex queries. For example, you can select two or more sets of results and find results belonging to all sets (logical <em>and</em>), or any sets (logical <em>or</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use Makefile and a <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/make/\" target=\"other\">make</a> utility to automate the process of building and installing this software. A PhysioNet mirror has all of the required prerequisites. If you are not installing onto a PhysioNet mirror, you will need to have installed the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml\">WFDB software package</a>, <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/libcurl/\">libcurl</a>, and (for the standalone tool only) <a href=\"http:/www.gnu.org/s/readline/\" target=\"other\">libreadline</a>. To install and use <strong>pbsearch</strong>, you will also need to have <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org\" target=\"other\">Apache <strong>httpd</strong></a> configured to run CGI perl scripts in /home/physionet/cgi-bin/. It is recommended that you make a local copy of the PhysioBank Index in the default location (see above), and this is necessary if your machine does not have a network connection. If you have all of the prerequisites, run the command (in this directory):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nmake install\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>to install this entire package, and run the command:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nmake check\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>to perform a quick test of its basic functionality. If you want <strong>pbsqsd</strong> to start automatically whenever the computer is rebooted, you must set up this behavior manually (on Linux, typically by adding <strong>pbsqsd</strong> to /etc/rc.local).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To force the server to reread the index if it has been updated, send it a SIGHUP, for example, by running the command</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nkillall -HUP pbsqsd\r\n</pre>",

Since I no longer have the CMS monitor that I used for development of record, I am not able to test alternative hardware or software configurations; you are on your own! </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A (non-free) alternative to record is the <a href=\"http://194.95.45.44/~xlns/dataplore/monitoring.html\" target=\"other\">Data Acquisition Interface for CMS Patient Monitors</a> available as an optional module for <a href=\"http://www.ixellence.com/\" target=\"other\">Dataplore</a> (proprietary software for analysis of signals and time series, available for GNU/Linux or MS-Windows). This software allows the use of a single serial port at up to 38400 baud, which limits the number of signals that can be recorded from the monitor. A newer version of this software, <a href=\"http://194.95.45.44/~xlns/trend/trend_sw_eng.html\" target=\"other\">TrendFace</a>, is specified to work at 115200 baud, allowing more signals to be recorded simultaneously. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About record</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>record is an MS-DOS application that determines what signals and measurements are available from a Hewlett-Packard (Agilent/Philips) Merlin (a.k.a. CMS or Component Monitoring System) patient monitor, and then logs all of the available data to disk continuously until it is stopped by the user. The monitor contains up to eight plug-in modules for monitoring physiologic signals (ECG, respiration, pressures, temperature, gases, etc.), and can be reconfigured by the user by inserting or removing modules at any time without restarting the monitor. record, however, determines only which signals and measurements are available at the time it is started, and does not attempt to keep track of modules added later. Signals and measurements are considered available only if the associated module and the transducer are connected and the parameter is turned on; note that a signal or measurement need not be displayed on the monitor screen to be available (in fact, record cannot determine what subset of available parameters is being displayed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to use record, the Merlin monitor must be equipped with at least one, and ideally two, serial interface cards. These are available as <em>options</em> from HP (Agilent, now Philips Medical Systems; most Merlin monitors are not equipped with these cards). Each card supports two serial lines, one at speeds up to 38400 baud, and the second at speeds up to 9600 baud (other possibilities are described below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wrote record in order to gather real-time patient data for the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimicdb/\">MIMIC (Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care) Database project</a>. The currently completed portion of the MIMIC Database (about 200 patient-days) is freely available via PhysioNet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you find record useful, please let me know how you are using it, by e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:george@mit.edu\">george@mit.edu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Obtaining record</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may download record in precompiled form or in source form from this site. The precompiled version requires a DigiBoard PC/4e or compatible `smart&#39; serial card (recommended, see below). With minor modifications to the sources, you can compile a version of record that can be used with the PC&#39;s standard serial ports (not recommended in most cases, since they cannot keep up with the Merlin&#39;s output) or with other smart serial cards. (Note that you should not do this just to save money -- in order to recompile the sources, you will need to buy subroutine libraries from Greenleaf Software, as well as Borland or Turbo C if you don&#39;t have one of these already; the DigiBoard card will be less expensive if you can obtain one.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wish to use the precompiled version, download <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/record.exe\"> record.exe</a> and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/record.ini\">record.ini</a>, and save both of them in a directory somewhere in your MS-DOS execution path.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Compiling record</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not necessary to compile record unless you wish to modify it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>record has been successfully compiled using Turbo C/C++ 3.0 and Borland C/C++ 4.0. Earlier versions of these compilers may work as well, but will require recompiling the external libraries as well as the program source. It should be fairly easy to port record to Microsoft C (all of the libraries it uses can be compiled by Microsoft C/C++ compilers without changes; this program uses Borland/Turbo-specific functions for screen output, for far heap memory allocation, and for checking the available disk space, but close equivalents are provided with Microsoft C).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To recompile record using Borland or Turbo make, follow the instructions in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/src/makefile\">makefile</a>. (You should download not only <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/src/record.c\">record.c</a>, but also all of the other files within the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/src\">src</a> directory, in order to do this.) record makes use of three external libraries:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The <em>MECIF library</em> (mecif.lib), version A.01.10, originally available as Part No. M1046-9220C (Dec. 1992) from Hewlett-Packard (Agilent Heathcare Solutions Group, now part of Philips Medical Systems). This library contains functions that support serial communication between the PC and the HP CMS monitor. This software package is provided with the CMS RS-232 card, on an MS-DOS diskette (containing the library itself in source and binary forms, various header (.h) files, a demonstration program, and documentation files), and is accompanied by a manual titled &quot;<em>HP Component Monitoring System RS-232 Computer Interface Programming Guide (Option #J13)</em>&quot;, referred to below as the <em>HP Guide</em>. A <a href=\"https://physionet.org/faq.shtml#tar-gz\">gzip-compressed tar archive</a> of the contents of the MS-DOS diskette may be downloaded from <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/mecif.tar.gz\">here</a>, by permission of the author and Philips Medical Systems. The original version of the MECIF library uses the standard PC serial ports, which are not suitable for high-bandwidth applications. To produce an enhanced version that can use a `smart&#39; serial interface such as the Digiboard PC/4e (recommended), copy the MECIF library sources from the MS-DOS diskette to a directory on your hard drive, then copy the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/src/mecif/makefile\">makefile</a> and <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/src/mecif/rs232g.c\">rs232g.c</a> into the same directory, then follow the instructions in the makefile to build the library.</li>\r\n\t<li>The <em>Greenleaf CommLib library</em> (gfcl.lib), version 4.0, available from <a href=\"http://www.greenleafsoftware.com/\" target=\"other\">Greenleaf Software</a>, sysFire LLC, Forest Park Gardens, Suite 309, 9550 Forest Lane, Dallas, TX 75243 USA (telephone: 1 800 523 9830 (USA/Canada only), or +1 214 349 3005). This library contains functions invoked by rs232g.c (see above) that support low-level serial communications using many different types of PC serial ports, including &quot;smart&quot; serial cards; this program does not call any CommLib functions directly. The package includes MS-DOS diskettes (containing the library in source form, various header files, and example programs), and a manual titled &quot;<em>Greenleaf CommLib 4.0 Reference</em>&quot;, referred to in record.c as the <em>CommLib manual</em>. The sources can be compiled by many popular C compilers, including those from Borland and Microsoft; specify the primary compiler to be used when ordering CommLib, and the package will also include precompiled versions of the library for use with that compiler and various memory models. Be sure to use gfcl.lib (the large memory model version) with record. CommLib is required in order to use the enhanced version of the MECIF library described above; it is not required in order to use the Hewlett-Packard version. Although executable programs built using CommLib may be distributed without restriction, gfcl.lib may not be.</li>\r\n\t<li>The <em>WFDB library</em> (<a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/src/dbl.lib\">dbl.lib</a>), version 9.0 or later, provided here in C source form and in binary form for Turbo C/C++ 3.0 and Borland C/C++ 4.0. This library includes functions that record uses to create files of received data in a compact, portable, binary format. The <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/dbpg/\"> <em>WFDB Programmer&#39;s Guide</em></a>, referred to in record.c as the <em>DB Guide</em>, describes how to use this library. Be sure to use dbl.lib (the large memory model version) with record.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It is possible to compile record using the version of mecif.lib provided on the HP diskette and without using CommLib, and to use it with the standard PC serial ports (COM1 and COM2). The use of the revised MECIF library as described above, the CommLib library, and a `smart&#39; serial card is strongly recommended as an alternative, permitting reliable operation at top speed while logging data to local drives. Without the use of CommLib and a smart serial card, record is limited to logging data to network drives. (Characters arrive at 260 microsecond intervals on each of the 38400 baud serial lines. Serial interrupts are locked out for several milliseconds during local disk writes. Without a smart card, characters that arrive while writing to the disk are lost. Although the MECIF protocol incorporates limited error detection, there is no provision for error correction or retransmission of lost messages. Lacking a smart serial card, it is possible to log data to a network drive, since the network interface accepts data at PC bus speeds, avoiding the local disk&#39;s interrupt latency.) This operating mode has been tested using a 3Com Etherlink III Ethernet interface card, with Sun PC-NFS networking software used to access the network drives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The executable version of record provided here has been compiled for use with the DigiBoard PC/4e (or PC/8i) board, manufactured by <a href=\"http://www.digiboard.com/\" target=\"other\">Digi International</a>, 11001 Bren Road East, Minnetonka, MN 55343 USA (telephone: 1 800 344 4273 (USA/Canada only) or +1 952 912 3444). Other serial devices supported by CommLib (hence the revised MECIF library) include smart cards from Arnet and Star Gate; a one-line change in rs232g.c is required in order to recompile a version of mecif.lib for use with any of these cards. Unfortunately, none of the smart serial cards supported by CommLib is still manufactured, so you will need to find a used card (frequently offered for sale on www.ebay.com) or else find a newer model that is supported by CommLib, or else devise a way to use another smart serial card without the use of CommLib. If you succeed, please <a href=\"mailto:george@mit.edu?subject=smart serial card for record\"> tell me about it</a>. The enhanced MECIF library also incorporates more robust error-recovery that avoids the need to reboot the monitor in the event of interrupted transmissions, a problem that occurs regularly when using the original version of mecif.lib from the diskette.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Running record</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To use record:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Connect the HP monitor to the PC using standard serial printer cables (see the wiring diagram on page 2-2 of the <em>HP Guide</em>). Up to four lines may be used.</li>\r\n\t<li>Turn on both the monitor and the PC.</li>\r\n\t<li>Run the program by typing\r\n\t<pre>\r\n\trecord\r\n</pre>\r\n\tor\r\n\r\n\t<pre>\r\n\trecord <em>FILE</em>\r\n</pre>\r\n\t(where <em>FILE</em> is the name of a configuration file such as <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/record.ini\">record.ini</a>).</li>\r\n\t<li>Enter the data requested (patient name and ID). Note that this information is recorded only in the index file (see below), and not in the logged data files.</li>\r\n\t<li>Once recording has begun, use the monitor&#39;s controls to generate a set of calibration pulses. These will be needed to calibrate the recorded signals later on.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>record checks the available serial lines and sets the speeds of the PC&#39;s ports to match those of the monitor. The best results will be obtained using the highest available speeds, permitting the maximum amount of data to be retrieved. If the total available bandwidth is insufficient to permit the monitor to transmit all signals and measurements, record attempts to obtain as many signals as possible, and then as many measurements as possible using the remaining bandwidth. If record is used routinely in a setting in which the bandwidth is insufficient, it may be worth modifying the code to permit the user to select which signals and measurements are to be recorded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The monitor may have one or two RS232 serial cards installed in it (two are necessary in order to provide suffficient bandwidth to acquire all signals in most cases). Each RS232 card provides two ports. The lower ports are designated ports 1 and 3, and support communications at 9600, 19200, and 38400 baud; the upper ports (2 and 4) are restricted to 9600 baud (or 19200 baud if the lower port on the same card is not running at 38400 baud). The TX/RX order should be <em>Low/High</em> for all connected ports. These settings cannot be changed from the PC; refer to the <em>HP Guide</em> (pp. 2-4 to 2-9) for information on changing them using the monitor&#39;s controls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following baud rate settings are recommended (choose the first set that works from the list):</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:100%\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Port 1</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Port 2</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Port 3</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Port 4</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Description</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>38400</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>9600</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>38400</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>9600</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<pre>\r\n* maximum bandwidth</pre>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>38400</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>38400</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<pre>\r\n** maximum bandwidth with only two lines</pre>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>19200</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>19200</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>19200</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>19200</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<pre>\r\n* use with modems or long cables if 38400 baud can&#39;t be used</pre>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>38400</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>9600</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<pre>\r\nmaximum bandwidth with only one RS232 card</pre>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>38400</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<pre>\r\nmaximum bandwidth with only one line</pre>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Note that the revised MECIF library must be used in order to make use of three or four ports (the standard library supports only two). In some monitor configurations, the use of three or four ports fails for unknown reasons (apparently not related to record or to the PC hardware). For this reason, the default configuration (**) uses only ports 1 and 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any of the first three choices provides sufficient bandwidth in most cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are using a version of record compiled for use with a DigiBoard PC/4e or PC/8i serial card, connections should be made using ports P1, P2, P3, and P4 (which should be configured as COM5, COM6, COM7, and COM8) of the DigiBoard interface, and the DigiBoard driver (currently xidos5.sys) should be loaded. Otherwise, use the PC serial ports COM1 and COM2 (depending on your hardware, COM3 and COM4 may or may not be usable as well). It makes no difference which PC port is connected to which monitor port.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For details on setting options in record, see <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/record.ini\"> record.ini</a>, which is a sample configuration file. record sets its options using the first available source from the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>a file named on the command line (for example, record myconfig.ini)</li>\r\n\t<li>a file named in the environment variable RCONFIG (for example, by the command `set RCONFIG=c:\\record\\myconfig.ini&#39;)</li>\r\n\t<li>a file named record.ini found in the same directory as record.exe</li>\r\n\t<li>the compiled-in defaults shown in <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/record/src/record.c\">record.c</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus a file named on the command line takes precedence over a file named in RCONFIG, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About the output</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Each time it runs, record reads and updates an `index file&#39;. The index file may be named in the configuration file (by default, it is record.idx in the same directory as record.exe). The index file is a text file. Each line in it contains data for one run of record. The first field of each line is the run index number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The run index number is the name of the directory in which the log files for this run are collected (see below). By default, this directory is placed in c:\\, but any other location may be specified using the configuration file. If space on the drive containing the log directory becomes nearly exhausted, and a `spillover&#39; directory (presumably on a different drive) has been specified in the configuration file, record switches to that directory. Only one `spillover&#39; directory may be specified; if none is specified, record does not use a `spillover&#39; directory. When almost all of the available space has been used, record exits (it avoids writing on the last few blocks).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The log files contain the data retrieved from the monitor. At regular intervals (10 minutes by default), record closes the current set of log files and opens a new set; this strategy limits the amount of data lost if there is an interruption in power or other system failure. Each set of log files is identified by a five-digit sequence number contained within the names of the files. The first three characters of the file name are the index number (modulo 1000), and the next five are the sequence number (beginning with 00001). (In the unlikely event that more than 99,999 sets of log files are created, the index number is incremented and the files continue to be generated in numerical order.) The suffix (.dat, .al, or .nu) indicates what type of data will be found in the file (sampled signals, annotations of alarms and signal connections/disconnections, or numerics). An ASCII header (.hea) file accompanies each set, and contains the date and time (from the system clock) at which the files in the set were created, along with information necessary to read the .dat and .al files using DB application programs (such as view for MS-DOS, wview for MS-Windows, and wave for Linux, SunOS, and Solaris; visit our web site to obtain these applications, or to obtain details of the file formats if you wish to write your own programs for reading record output files).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, log files of different types will have different lengths, but all log files of any given type should have approximately the same length, with the following exceptions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The last file of each type may be shorter than the others.</li>\r\n\t<li>If alarms or `inop&#39; conditions occur, the corresponding .al and .txt files will be longer than the others.</li>\r\n\t<li>If a module was removed from the monitor during the run, the log files obtained during that period may be shorter than the others.</li>\r\n\t<li>Log files open when messages were lost may be shorter than the others.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Except for the first case, careful attention should be paid to any log files that differ significantly in length from others of the same type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>record also logs its run-time errors in an error log (by default, record.log, in the same directory as record.exe). The error log should be consulted after each run.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating a composite (multi-segment) record from a set of output files</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although record saves its output in segments that are (by default) 10 minutes in length, you may wish to concatenate the segments for ease of access by other software, as we have done for the MIMIC database. This process is quite simple and fast (though the description below is a bit long), and does not require any significant additional disk space (the data files need not be copied).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use other software available from PhysioNet to create a composite record from the log files generated by record. The following instructions assume that you have collected the log files in a directory named <em>NNN</em>, where <em>NNN</em> is record&#39;s `run number&#39;, and that you are running Linux (or Solaris, or SunOS); it is possible to do most of what is described below under MS-DOS or MS-Windows, with minor modifications (see the documentation available on PhysioNet, in particular the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wag/\">WFDB Applications Guide</a>, for details).</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Determine the number of segments in each record:\r\n\t<pre>\r\n        cd <em>NNN</em>\r\n        ls | tail\r\n</pre>\r\n\tThe output from `ls | tail&#39; will look something like this:\r\n\r\n\t<pre>\r\n        <em>NNN</em>00122.hea\r\n        <em>NNN</em>00122.txt\r\n        <em>NNN</em>00123.al\r\n        <em>NNN</em>00123.dat\r\n        <em>NNN</em>00123.hea\r\n        <em>NNN</em>00123.txt\r\n        <em>NNN</em>00124.al\r\n        <em>NNN</em>00124.dat\r\n        <em>NNN</em>00124.hea\r\n        <em>NNN</em>00124.txt\r\n</pre>\r\n\tNote the segment number of the last segment (124 in the example above). Use this number as shown in this command:\r\n\r\n\t<pre>\r\n        wfdbcollate <em>NNN</em> 1 124 -a al\r\n</pre>\r\n\tPay careful attention to any warnings or error messages that appear! In most cases, you will see a message of the form:\r\n\r\n\t<pre>\r\n        warning (init):\r\n         record <em>NNN</em>00XXX duration differs from that of previously opened record\r\n</pre>\r\n\twhere XXX is the segment number of the last segment. This is harmless, and may be ignored. On the other hand, if dbcollate reports that the sampling frequency is incorrect for the last segment, delete the files for the last segment (`rm *124.*&#39; in the example), and run dbcollate again (`dbcollate <em>NNN</em> 1 123 -a al&#39; in this case). This problem may occur in some cases when the last segment could not be properly finished by record.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/wug/\">wave</a> to view the collated record:\r\n\t<pre>\r\n        wave -r <em>NNN</em>\r\n</pre>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Locate the recorded calibration signals.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use wave&#39;s <em>View</em> panel to set the time scale to 125 mm/sec and the amplitude scale to 40 mm/mV; check `Markers&#39; in the top row, and choose `attached to signals&#39; from the `Show annotations&#39; menu, then click on `Redraw&#39;. Once you have found the calibration signals, enable annotation editing (using the `Edit&#39; menu button), then place `N&#39; labels (or other annotations of your choice) at matching points on the calibration pulses for each ECG signal (the pulses for the other signals can&#39;t be aligned, so ignore them). It&#39;s best to make more than one set of measurements. Now select `Analyze&#39; from wave&#39;s `File&#39; menu, and click on `List annotations&#39;.</li>\r\n\t<li>Examine the output of `rdann&#39; (it appears in the `Analysis commands&#39; window; click on `Show command window&#39; if you don&#39;t see it). It will appear something like this:\r\n\t<pre>\r\n        [08:12:02.784 01/12/1994]     2348     N    0    0    0\r\n        [08:12:02.784 01/12/1994]     2348     N    0    2    0\r\n        [08:12:02.848 01/12/1994]     2356     N    0    1    0\r\n        [08:12:03.712 01/12/1994]     2464     N    0    0    0\r\n        [08:12:03.712 01/12/1994]     2464     N    0    2    0\r\n        [08:12:03.776 01/12/1994]     2472     N    0    1    0\r\n</pre>\r\n\tEach row of output corresponds to a single annotation. The second column from the right indicates which signal each annotation is associated with (0, 1, or 2), and the column to the left of the N codes shows the exact time in samples of the annotation. In this example, there are two sets of annotations, and in each set, the signal 1 annotation occurs 8 samples later than those for signals 0 and 2. The units of skew for ECG signals are 1/4 of a sample interval; thus the skew for signal 1 is 32 (= 8 * 4). (By definition, the signal for which the calibration pulse is observed earliest has a skew of zero; this may not always be signal 0, however.) Because of the way the HP monitor transmits data, we can be quite certain that all skews will be multiples of 16; the largest skew I have observed is 64. In most cases, two signals are already synchronized and only the third has a non-zero skew, most often either 16 or 32 as in this example.</li>\r\n\t<li>Determine the skews for each ECG signal, then exit from wave and run skewedit to correct for the measured skews. In this example, this would be done by\r\n\t<pre>\r\n        skewedit <em>NNN</em> 0 32 0\r\n</pre>\r\n\twhere <em>NNN</em> is the record name, and the arguments that follow it are the skews for signals 0, 1, and 2. When running skewedit, any trailing zeroes may be omitted from the argument list (thus `skewedit <em>NNN</em> 0 32&#39; is equivalent to the command above). After running skewedit, open the record again using wave and verify that you have corrected the skew properly. (Note that skewedit always sets the absolute skew, so if you need to make further adjustments, add any corrections to the previous skews.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Reopen the record using wave and calibrate any signals that can be calibrated. Locate the calibration signals. Set wave&#39;s signal list so that it includes only those signals that are to be calibrated. Mark (with `&lt;&#39; and &#39;&gt;&#39; markers) a segment that contains both the low-amplitude and the high-amplitude regions of the calibration signals. Click on `Calibrate&#39;, and answer any questions that appear in the command window. Reopen the record and check that the signals have been calibrated properly. Repeat this step as necessary.\r\n\t<p>Note that the calibration signals for ECGs are 2 mV peak-to-peak, and that the most common calibration steps for the ABP signal are 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 mmHg (there is at least one other ABP calibration signal with usable steps of 60 and 0 mmHg only).</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Clean up the directory in which you have been working:\r\n\t<pre>\r\n        rm -f <em>NNN</em>.wave*\r\n        chmod 444 *\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\t<p>The first of these commands removes any annotation files you created while measuring and correcting for skew, and the last command sets all of the data files to read-only mode.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "full_description": "<h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the USA, the HIPAA Privacy Rule restricts exchange of medical data containing protected health information (PHI), defined as any information that might be used to identify the individual(s) from whom the data were collected. Data known to contain PHI can be shared for research purposes only under tightly controlled circumstances, typically involving data use agreements under which the researchers involved must obtain IRB or equivalent approvals for use of the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, medical data that do not contain PHI are exempt from the restrictions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and may be shared freely. The data available on PhysioNet fall into this category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the research data sets currently being collected by PhysioNet are accompanied by PHI, and the process of removing this PHI (&quot;de-identification&quot; in the language of HIPAA, or &quot;anonymization&quot;) is tedious and error-prone. For many research projects, the cost of de-identification is a significant barrier to data sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MIMIC II project has invested several years&#39; effort to develop and evaluate software that is capable of removing PHI from text and, where appropriate, replacing it by realistic surrogate PHI. (For example, names are replaced by fictitious names, medical record numbers by fictitious medical record numbers, dates by fictitious dates, geographic locations by other geographic locations, etc.) The MIMIC II project has contributed to PhysioNet both its deidentification software, which may be useful to other researchers needing to remove PHI from their own data, and a large corpus of text drawn from ICU nursing notes that were gathered simultaneously with the signals, trends, laboratory reports, discharge summaries and other data in the MIMIC II clinical and waveform databases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Software</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As is the case with all software available on PhysioNet, the de-identification software (<code>deid</code>) is provided in source form so that its workings can be studied, customized, and improved. This software is free software. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors of the <code>deid</code> software package are Margaret M Douglass, Li-wei H Lehman, William J Long, and Ishna Neamatullah. An experimental prototype by Jason M Levine provided useful guidance in the design of <code>deid</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prerequisite</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>deid</code> package requires Perl (version 5 or later), which is freely available for all popular platforms <a href=\"http://perl.org/\" target=\"other\">here</a> if you don&#39;t have it already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current version of the <code>deid</code> software package was developed and tested using perl 5.8.8 and perl 5.10 on GNU/Linux (Fedora Core 10). It has also been tested on Fedora 6, 7 and 8, Ubuntu 8.04, MacOS X 10.4.5, and on MS-Windows XP.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Downloading and installing <code>deid</code></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>deid</code> software package can be downloaded as a single file, <code>deid-1.1.tar.gz</code>. The contents of <code>deid-1.1.tar.gz</code> unpack into a directory named <code>deid-1.1</code>, which contains the files listed below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>deid</code> software package is command-line software that must be run in a terminal emulator (console) window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Testing <code>deid</code></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wish to test <code>deid</code>, see <em>Data: the gold-standard corpus of deidentified medical text</em> below for information on obtaining <code>id.text</code> and <code>id.res</code>. Copy <code>id.text</code> into the <code>deid-1.1</code> directory (created when <code>deid-1.1.tar.gz</code> was unpacked in the previous step), and enter that directory. Type the command</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<pre>\r\nperl deid.pl id deid.config\r\n</pre>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The software will print a greeting message:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<pre>\r\n    *******************************************************************************************************************\r\n    De-Identification Algorithm: Identifies Protected Health Information (PHI) in Discharge Summaries and Nursing Notes\r\n    *******************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n    Starting de-identification (version 1.1) ...\r\n\r\n    Running deid in output mode. Output files will be: \r\n    id.phi: the PHI locations found by the code.\r\n    id.res: the scrubbed text.\r\n    id.info: debug info about the PHI locations.\r\n</pre>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>On a typical current PC, the process will run to completion in approximately 10 to 20 minutes. The three output files will be written into the current directory; they should be identical to the files of the same names that are included in the <code>GSoutput</code> directory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program <code>runStat.pl</code> can be used to derive performance statistics by comparing the <code>id.phi</code> file generated by <code>deid.pl</code> with the reference <code>id.deid</code> file provided with the <code>deid</code> software package. To do this, type the command</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<pre>\r\nperl runStat.pl id.deid id.phi\r\n</pre>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>which should produce the output</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<pre>\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nNum of true positives = 1720\r\n\r\nNum of false positives = 546\r\n\r\nNum of false negatives = 59\r\n\r\nSensitivity/Recall = 0.967\r\n\r\nPPV/Specificity = 0.748\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>To use the gold standard corpus to test the performance of another deidentifier, arrange for that deidentifier to produce a file in the format of <code>id.phi</code>, then use <code>runStat.pl</code> as above.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Customizing <code>deid</code></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Examine the configuration file, <code>deid.config</code>, to see how to modify the behavior of <code>deid.pl</code>. For additional information, see the user manual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to customize this software to de-identify free text in other medical records, you may replace our filter modules with your data-specific filters. Additionally, at a minimum, you will have to replace the six files that contain a priori information (see below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the text you wish to de-identify, you may wish to re-classify names as ambiguous or not. For example, &quot;Mae&quot; is an unambiguous name in most contexts, but in nursing and discharge notes, it may be an acronym (meaning &ldquo;moving all extremities&rdquo;) and it is therefore ambiguous in those contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contents of the <code>deid</code> package</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>See above for information about downloading the entire <code>deid</code> package in a single archive file.

Its configuration file, <code>deid.config</code>, can be used to set parameters of the deidentification process at run time. Associated word and phrase lists are in <code>lists/</code> (containing known and possible PHI) and <code>dict/</code> (containing probable non-PHI).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the date shift filter is on, <code>deid</code> replaces all dates in its input with surrogate dates. The <code>shift.txt</code> file contains a randomly assigned date shift (between 1000 and 3000 days) for each patient in the gold standard corpus; surrogate dates are generated by adding the specified number of days to the dates in the input file. The method used to generate the date shifts in <code>shift.txt</code> differs from that used in PhysioBank databases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The file <code>id-phi.phrase</code> is provided as a convenient index to the PHI in the gold standard corpus; it is not used by the deid software. Each line of this file contains 6 fields: PID, Record_Number, PHI_Start_Location, PHI_End_Location, PHI_Type, and PHI_Text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The file <code>id.deid</code> also contains PHI locations in the gold standard corpus, and it is used as a reference for calculating performance statistics by the functions in <code>stats.pm</code>. It contains two types of lines. The first type is of the form</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<pre>\r\nPatient <em>PID</em> Note <em>Record_Number</em>\r\n</pre>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>and the second type is of the form</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<pre>\r\n<em>PHI_Start_Location PHI_Start_Location PHI_End_Location</em>\r\n</pre>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Data: the gold-standard corpus of deidentified medical text</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Evaluating software for de-identification turns out to be quite difficult. As in many of the projects contributing to PhysioNet, a reference database is highly useful. Ideally the developer of de-identification software needs an appropriate corpus of text in which all of the PHI has been labelled, so that the software&#39;s PHI detection performance can be assessed quickly and quantitatively. To compare different approaches to PHI removal objectively, we need a standard corpus. And here&#39;s the dilemma: we can&#39;t share such a corpus if it has any PHI in it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>deid</code> software package was developed and tested using a gold standard corpus of 2,434 nursing notes that have been thoroughly deidentified by a multi-pass process that included meticulous reviews by three or more experts working independently, as well as by a variety of automated methods. All detected instances of PHI in these nursing notes have been replaced by realistic surrogate data in the gold standard corpus. Although the <code>deid</code> software, as noted above, may be redistributed under the terms of the GPL, the gold standard corpus, because of the very small possibility that it may contain one or more instances of undetected PHI, is currently available only to those who have been granted access to PhysioNet Clinical Databases (such as MIMIC-III).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply for access to the gold standard corpus, please see the Deidentified Medical Text page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Further reading</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Neamatullah I. <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/deid/doc/ishna-meng-thesis.pdf\">Automated De-Identification of Free-Text Medical Records</a>.

This technique employs the Hilbert transformation of the sinus interbeat (NN) interval time series to derive the instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies of the series, and calculates their averages and standard deviations over a moving 5-minute window. We then apply a thresholding technique and detect continuous sequences of those windows that lie within threshold limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When applied to the training set of the Apnea-ECG Database created for the CinC Challenge 2000, this algorithm correctly classified 26 of 30 subjects (86.6%), and correctly identified the presence or absence of sleep apnea in 13895 of 17045 minutes (82.1%). When applied to the test set of the Apnea-ECG Database, this algorithm performed even better, correctly classifying 28 out of 30 cases (93.3%) of subjects, and 14591 of 17268 minutes (84.5%).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Obtaining the apdet package</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The apdet software package is available in source form and as prebuilt binaries for Linux and MS-Windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Before building or using the apdet software, you must install the free WFDB software package.</strong> Under MS-Windows, you will also need to install the free <a href=\"http://www.cygwin.com/\" target=\"other\">Cygwin environment</a> before building or using the apdet software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unpacking the apdet package requires tar and gzip, and running the software requires sh (or a compatible shell such as bash), and awk, all of which can be found on all Unix, Linux, and Mac OS/X systems, and in the Cygwin environment for MS-Windows. Cygwin also includes the gcc C compiler and all other utilities needed to compile the apdet package from sources if desired.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Downloading and installing the apdet package</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have installed the WFDB software package (and, under MS-Windows, the Cygwin environment), download and install the apdet package of your choice:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Download apdet.src.tar.gz.

In the example above, get_apdet will analyze record a03, annotator qrs from the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/apnea-ecg/\">Apnea-ECG Database</a>. (If you have not previously downloaded the input data into a local apnea-ecg directory, get_apdet obtains the data directly from PhysioNet.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The get_apdet command prints the times of detection of sleep apnea heart rate oscillations and the total fraction of time with such detections. For the example above, the output is:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<pre>\r\n00:05:59 - 00:59:59\r\n01:39:59 - 02:28:59\r\n03:04:59 - 03:52:59\r\n03:57:59 - 04:22:59\r\n04:38:59 - 05:03:59\r\n05:56:59 - 06:48:59\r\n06:58:59 - 07:24:59\r\n07:45:59 - 08:39:59\r\n\r\ntot = 05:33:00 / 08:42:25 = 0.637\r\n</pre>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>See an <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/apdet/a03.html\">illustration of these detections</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>get_apdet relies entirely on normal-to-normal beat interval data, which it normally derives from a beat annotation file. Beat annotation files are available for most of the PhysioBank records that include ECGs. If you wish to study a recording for which no beat annotation file is available, you may be able to create one using sqrs. If you have interbeat interval data but not a beat annotation file, you can modify get_apdet as needed, or you can use rr2ann to put your data into the standard format before processing them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How does get_apdet work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The sequence of steps involved in the detection of the RR interval oscillations, as implemented by get_apdet, is as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The normal-to-normal (NN) intervals are derived:<br />\r\n\trrlist $ANN $REC -a N<br />\r\n\tIf the input files ($REC.$ANN and $REC.hea) are not in the current directory, rrlist looks for them in the PhysioBank archives on PhysioNet.</li>\r\n\t<li>The NN interval series is then filtered to remove outliers:<br />\r\n\tfilt 0.2 20 -x 0.4 2.0</li>\r\n\t<li>The series is then linearly resampled at 1 Hz ...<br />\r\n\tlinsamp 1.0</li>\r\n\t<li>... then locally detrended using a moving 40 second window ...<br />\r\n\tldetrend 40</li>\r\n\t<li>... and smoothed using a moving 5 second window:<br />\r\n\tsmooth 5</li>\r\n\t<li>Next, the Hilbert transform is applied to derive instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies:<br />\r\n\tht</li>\r\n\t<li>The Hilbert amplitudes and frequencies are then median filtered using a 60 second window:<br />\r\n\thtmedfilt 60</li>\r\n\t<li>The amplitudes are normalized such that the average amplitude equals 1.0 (using awk).</li>\r\n\t<li>The midpoint of the Hilbert amplitudes is found (using awk and mm), and the minimum Hilbert amplitude threshold is set to<br />\r\n\t<em>THRES = a + b*(mid+1)/2</em><br />\r\n\twhere <em>a = -0.555</em> and <em>b = 1.3</em> (note: the values of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> were given incorrectly in the original publication; please refer to the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/apdet/apdet.shtml\">posted version</a> instead.)</li>\r\n\t<li>The mean Hilbert amplitudes and frequencies, their standard deviations and fraction of time within their specified threshold limits are calculated over 5-minute windows incremented each minute:<br />\r\n\thtavsd 1:00 5:00 <em>THRES</em></li>\r\n\t<li>Those windows where the means, standard deviations and threshold times of the Hilbert amplitudes and frequencies are all within their specified limits are selected (using awk).</li>\r\n\t<li>Apnea is detected whenever at least 15 consecutive windows are selected in the previous step, and the times of the detected apneic periods are printed:<br />\r\n\tdetruns 1:00 5:00 15:00</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This program correctly identifies the presence or absence of apnea in in 82.1% of the data in the CinC test set and 84.5% of the data in the CinC training set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is recommended that the accuracy of the oscillation detections be verified by visual inspection of the original RR interval series.</p>",

    "slug": "cardiacoutput",
    "abstract": "<p>This project contains the code used for a study that rigorously compares 11 estimates against thermodilution cardiac output (TCO) using 120 subjects from the MIMIC II database (all subjects for whom multiple TCO measurements were recorded at the time of the study).</p>",
    "full_description": "<h3>Background</h3>\n\n<p>Cardiac output (CO), defined as the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit time (often expressed in liters per minute), is the critical variable characterizing circulatory function, but it is also one of the most difficult to measure. Thermodilution cardiac output (TCO) is generally regarded as the &quot;gold standard&quot; among CO measurements. By introducing a small amount of cool fluid into the blood upstream of the heart, and observing how rapidly the blood temperature equilibrates, the flow and thus the CO can be calculated. TCO is highly invasive, intermittent, difficult to perform, and has sufficient potential to cause complications that it is used only when an accurate CO measurement is essential -- and even then, TCO errors are on the order of 15 to 20%.</p>\n\n<p>For over a century, many researchers have proposed alternative, minimally invasive or non-invasive methods of estimating CO, based on features of the arterial blood pressure waveform.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Software Description</h3>\n\n<p>This project contains the code used for a study that rigorously compares 11 estimates against TCO using 120 subjects from the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2db/\">MIMIC II database</a> (all subjects for whom multiple TCO measurements were recorded at the time of the study).</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>code</strong> directory contains Matlab implementations of the CO estimation algorithms, together with additional Matlab code to provide a set of tools for exploring CO estimators.</p>\n\n<p>The software in <strong>code/1extract/</strong> can use the waveform and numerics records to generate input files for the remaining software.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Underlying Data</h3>\n\n<p>The <strong>data </strong>directory contains a list of the original MIMIC II records used in this study.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/cardiac-output/doc/s54-5.pdf\">2005 study by Sun et al.</a>, the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2wdb/\">MIMIC II Waveform Database</a> included 120 pairs of records (the &quot;study records&quot;) that included both ABP waveforms and TCO measurements, and all of these were used in the study. The ABP signals, sampled at 125 Hz, can be found in the waveform records, and the reference TCO measurements, occurring at irregular intervals, can be found in the companion &quot;numerics&quot; records (identified by the same record names, but with an appended &quot;n&quot;). Demographic and clinical information, including age, gender, ICD9 codes, and medications, was available in the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/mimic2/mimic2_clinical_overview.shtml\">MIMIC II Clinical Database</a> for 117 of the study records.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The file RECORDS lists the study records, identifying them by their names within the now-obsolete version 2 of the MIMIC II Waveform Database, as was used in the study. If you wish to do anything other than exact replication of the 2005 study, we recommend using the corrected and expanded MIMIC II Waveform Database Matched Subset (for which age, gender, and detailed clinical information are available) or the much larger MIMIC II Waveform Database, version 3 (which includes many additional records for which age, gender, and clinical information are not available).</li>\n\t<li>File RECORDS-2005 also contains the names of the corrected copies of the study records within the current MIMIC II Waveform Database, version 3, as well as their version 2 record names, and the subject IDs for the associated patients&#39; records in the MIMIC II Clinical Database.</li>\n\t<li>File RECORDS-2014 contains an updated list of 535 records from 350 subjects with ABP signals, TCO measurements, age, and gender in the MIMIC II Waveform Database Matched Subset, and clinical data in the MIMIC II Clinical Database, including the 117 study records for which demographic and clinical data are available.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first column of RECORDS-2005 contains MIMIC II subject IDs for each record, which can be used to associate waveform and numerics data with demographic and clinical data. For example, in the MIMIC II Waveform Database Matched Subset, the ABP signals and TCO measurements for subject ID &quot;s00020&quot; can be found within <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2wdb/matched/s00020/\">http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2wdb/matched/s00020/</a>. The ABP and other signals are in waveform record s00020-2567-03-30-17-47 (as can be determined at the link above), and the TCO measurements are the non-zero values of the CO variable in numerics record s00020-2567-03-30-17-47n. The fields appended to the subject ID in these record name are the surrogate date (2567 March 30) and the actual starting time of the record (17:47 in the local time zone where the recording was made).</p>\n\n<p>In the MIMIC II Clinical Database, the initial &quot;s&quot; and any leading zeros are omitted from the subject ID. For example, demographic and clinical data for &quot;s00020&quot; appears in the MIMIC II Clinical Database as subject ID &quot;20&quot;. The last three cases in RECORDS-2005 are shown as subject ID &quot;sxxxxx&quot;; in these cases, there are no corresponding records in the MIMIC II Clinical Database, and age, gender, ICD9 codes, and medications are unknown for these three subjects.</p>\n\n<p>The second column of RECORDS-2005 contains the record names from the (obsolete) MIMIC II Waveform Database, version 2.</p>\n\n<p>For studies that require using the uncorrected data used in the 2005 study, within <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2db/\">http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2db/</a> are subdirectories for each record, containing WFDB-compatible waveform and numerics records. For example, the first entry in RECORDS is a40006; find the ABP signal in record mimic2db/a40006/a40006 <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2db/a40006/a40006_layout.hea\">[layout header]</a>, and the TCO measurements in record mimic2db/a40006/a40006n <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2db/a40006/a40006n.hea\">[header]</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The third column of RECORDS-2005, and any additional columns, contain the record names from the MIMIC II Waveform Database, version 3. The contents of these records are identical to those in the MIMIC II Waveform Database Matched Subset, except that their .hea files are undated (they contain the starting times but neither the actual nor the surrogate dates, and they do not contain the subjects&#39; age and gender). Note that if there is a gap of an hour or more in a subject&#39;s waveform and numerics recordings, there will be more than one MIMIC II Waveform Database version 3 record for that subject; although TCO measurements will be available in at least one of the records for each subject, they may not be present in all of a given subject&#39;s records. See the main page for the MIMIC II Waveform Database, version 3, for details on locating these records.</p>\n\n<p>The other files here contain additional clinical information extracted from the MIMIC II Clinical Database for 117 of the study records:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>demographics.txt: sex, age*, and mean and standard deviation of hematocrit. * age over 89 is given as &gt;=90</li>\n\t<li>icd9.txt: ICD9 codes and brief descriptions during the ICU stay</li>\n\t<li>medications.txt: intravenous medications administered during the ICU stay<br>\n\t(not necessarily while ABP was being monitored)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Documentation and References</h3>\n\n<p>Detailed descriptions of the algorithms and data collected here can be found in the following papers, contained in the <strong>doc</strong> directory:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sun JX.

    "title": "ECG-Derived Respiration",
    "slug": "edr",
    "abstract": "<p>The ECG-Derived Respiration (EDR) technique is an approach to obtain a respiration signal from an ECG.. It is based on the observation that the positions of ECG electrodes on the chest surface move relative to the heart, and transthoracic impedance varies, as the lungs fill and empty.

    "full_description": "<h3>Background</h3>\n\n<p>Several techniques can be used to obtain a respiration signal from an ECG. A popular technique used in bedside patient monitors involves measuring transthoracic impedance using the ECG electrodes. Unlike those described below, this method obtains the respiration signal from the ECG <em>electrodes</em> rather than from the ECG <em>signal</em>. It requires special-purpose hardware and is not suited to recovering respiration from a recorded ECG, but it has the significant advantage (relative to the other methods mentioned here) that a continuous respiration-related waveform can be obtained.</p>\n\n<p>Another well-known method is based on observing the beat-to-beat variations in RR intervals or their reciprocals, which are primarily due to respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in most individuals. This method works best in young, healthy subjects, in whom RSA is most pronounced.</p>\n\n<p>The EDR (ECG-Derived Respiration) technique is a third approach. It is based on the observation that the positions of ECG electrodes on the chest surface move relative to the heart, and transthoracic impedance varies, as the lungs fill and empty. Thus the lead axes vary at different points in the respiratory cycle, and any sufficiently precise measurement of the mean cardiac electrical axis shows variations that are correlated with respiration. This method is particularly effective if two or more ECG signals are available, but a single lead is sufficient. The EDR can be obtained even in the context of congestive heart failure, in which RSA may be absent.</p>\n\n<p>None of these methods supplies a calibrated respiration signal; for tidal volume and air flow measurements, other techniques (spirometry, measurements from nasal thermistors, and plethysmography) are best. Nevertheless, any of these methods can provide a basis for estimating respiration rate and for detecting apneas.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Software Description</h3>\n\n<p>This project contains:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A short C program implementing the EDR, which can be used to derive a respiration-related signal from one or two ECG signals (precompiled binaries for Linux and MS-Windows are also available).</li>\n\t<li>The paper that introduced the technique.</li>\n\t<li>A second paper that describes applications for the EDR.</li>\n</ul>",

Most of the work to improve the score resulted from adjustments to filtering and alignment.</p>\n\n<p>TWAnalyser has been tested on both Windows XP (SP2) and Linux (Fedora Core 4-9) using Matlab R13 (6.5) and R2006b (7.3).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Data</strong></p>\n\n<p>TWAnalyser accepts digitized ECGs in PhysioBank-compatible formats. If you have ECGs in some other format and have Matlab software for reading them, it&#39;s not too difficult to modify TWAnalyser to work with your format. Otherwise, create PhysioBank-compatible records from your ECGs. If you wish to analyze a lengthy recording, you may wish to divide it into short segments (a few minutes each) first; this will save a <em>lot</em> of time.</p>\n\n<p>TWAnalyser requires a set of Q-onset, S-end, and T-end annotations for the ECGs to be analysed. If these are not available, TWAnalyser uses ecgpuwave to produce them. You also have the option of providing your own annotation files. In that case the names of the annotation files should end with .vf or .pu and their contents should mimic the format used by ecgpuwave. Specifically, annotation files should be stored in PhysioBank-compatible format, and they should include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Q-onset annotations (anntyp&nbsp;=&nbsp;WFON, num&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, chan&nbsp;=&nbsp;0)</li>\n\t<li>S-end annotations (anntyp&nbsp;=&nbsp;WFOFF, num&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, chan&nbsp;=&nbsp;0)</li>\n\t<li>T-end annotations (anntyp&nbsp;=&nbsp;WFOFF, num&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, chan&nbsp;=&nbsp;0)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read about annotations <a href=\"https://physionet.org/faq.shtml#annotation\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Software</strong></p>\n\n<p>TWAnalyser requires Matlab and WFDB. If the required annotations (see above) are not already available for the ECGs to be analyzed, ecgpuwave is also required. TWAnalyser and all of its prerequisite software are freely available under the terms of the <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html\">GPL</a>, with the exception of Matlab. It may be possible to run TWAnalyser using <a href=\"http://www.che.wisc.edu/octave/\">GNU Octave</a> or another freely available replacement for Matlab, but this has not been tested.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n\n<p>Under <strong>Linux</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Install Matlab, WFDB, WFDB_tools, and ecgpuwave if you have not already done so.</li>\n\t<li>Download and unpack twa-mfiles.tar.gz (or twa-mfiles.zip; or download individual source files for TWAnalyser).</li>\n\t<li>Add the twa-mfiles directory to the Matlab path.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Under <strong>Windows</strong>, you may follow the same procedure as for Linux. Alternatively:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Install Matlab if you have not already done so.</li>\n\t<li>Download and unpack twa-windows.zip.</li>\n\t<li>Enter the twa-windows directory and run setup.bat from the Windows command prompt.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Note that twa-windows.zip includes Windows executables that were built using version 10.4.4 of the WFDB library (from May 2006), which lacks features of recent versions such as support for reading EDF files.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Using TWAnalyser</h3>\n\n<p>There are three commands that will start the analysis for you. From the Matlab command prompt type one of the following:</p>\n\n<p><strong>DoTWASpectral</strong> [performs the SM and provides a graphical interface to explore the results]</p>\n\n<p>You are prompted to locate the ECG file you want to analyze. The SM interface consists of an ECG window, windows displaying successive superimposed beats, alternans series, periodogram and averaged periodogram. Navigation is possible in the ECG, superimposed beat and alternans series windows. One ECG lead at a time is displayed. You can switch leads using the button at the upper right corner of the interface window. A summary of the analysis results is at the top. All three available options (see the <a href=\"https://physionet.org/physiotools/TWAnalyser/docs/KhaustovNematiClifford.pdf\">paper</a>) for SM are displayed simultaneously (i.e., respective alternans series, periodograms and averaged periodograms are superimposed). You can remove the options you don&#39;t need by altering Param.MethodForEctopy in DoTWASpectral.m.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DoTWAbyMMA</strong> [performs the MMA and provides a graphical interface to explore the results]</p>\n\n<div>\n<p>You are prompted to locate the ECG file you want to analyze. The MMA interface consists of ECG window, windows displaying superimposed even and odd averages for the current interval, alternans value trend and two windows containing (even and odd) averages for previous and current interval plotted against the current beat. Navigation is possible in the ECG and trend windows. One lead at a time is displayed. You can switch leads using the button at the upper right corner of the interface window. A text string summarizing the analysis results is displayed at the top of the window.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>BatchTWA</strong> [performs a batch analysis for a set of records and outputs results into a text file]</p>\n\n<div>\n<p>For batch processing, set the current Matlab directory to the directory with all the data files. You are prompted to locate a file that contains a list of records to analyse (one record per string, no extensions). All available analysis options are performed. If you don&#39;t need something - alter the Metric and Method lists in BatchTWA.m . The results are stored in the current directory, in files twa_SM_replace.txt, twa_SM_differences.txt, twa_SM_lomb.txt, and twa_MMA.txt.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Future work</p>\n\n<p>We have a long to-do list planned for this software, including: pre-filtering with PCA (as was used by the winning closed-source entry in the competition, although this entry did not provide TWA magnitudes, only rankings); reporting of heart rate (TWA that manifests above 110 BPM is unlikely to be clinically significant); tests to determine the effects of the unevenly sampled nature of TWA; dealing with TWA phase changes (after ectopy for example) and indicators to quantify this effect.</p>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Khaustov A, Nemati S, Clifford GD An open-source standard T-wave alternans detector for benchmarking signals. <em>Computers in Cardiology</em> 2008.

    "full_description": "<h3>Background</h3>\n\n<p>The Global Electrical Heterogeneity (GEH) concept is based on the theory of Wilson&rsquo;s electrical gradient vector, which characterizes the degree of heterogeneity of the total recovery time across the ventricles.</p>\n\n<p>The larger the degree of heterogeneity of total recovery time across the ventricles, the larger the spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) magnitude. The SVG vector points towards the area where the total recovery time is shortest. SVG vector points the direction along which non-uniformities in excitation and repolarization are the greatest (i.e., it is perpendicular to the line of conduction block). Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrated that the SVG is related to global heterogeneity of both action potential duration and morphology.</p>\n\n<p>The concept underlying the SVG was extended to the spatial QRS-T angle, the three-dimensional angle between the QRS- and T-vectors and the sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST), a scalar analog of the SVG calculated as the absolute value of the area under the QRS complex and T-wave on the X, Y, and Z leads. The scalar value of SVG can also be calculated as a QT integral on Vector Magnitude signal (iVMQT), as an area under the Vector Magnitude signal curve from the QRS-onset to T-offset. Five GEH metrics (SVG magnitude, elevation, and azimuth, spatial QRS-T angle, and SAI QRST (or QT integral on Vector Magnitude signal, iVMQT) are complementary to each other; all together they characterize global electrophysiological properties of the heart.

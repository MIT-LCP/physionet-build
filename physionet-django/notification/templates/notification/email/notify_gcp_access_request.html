You have requested access to use {{ project }} in GCP Storage.

The URL for the storage bucket in GCP is:
https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/{{ project.gcp.bucket_name }}

You can use the following command to copy the content of the bucket to your computer:
gsutil -m -u YOUR_PROJECT_ID cp -r gs://{{ project.gcp.bucket_name }} DESTINATION

To access this bucket from the command line, you will need to set
up Google Cloud credentials as described here:
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install#authenticate

Dear {{ applicant_name }},

{% if application.status == 2 %}
We are pleased to say that your application for credentialed access to PhysioNet has been accepted. You are now a credentialed user with the ability to access restricted-access PhysioNet databases upon agreeing to the terms of usage.
{% else %}
Thank you for applying for credentialed access to PhysioNet. Your application was not approved. This may be for one of the following reasons:

- It was incomplete, or included obviously incorrect information (perhaps as a result of browser auto-fill).
- You did not submit the required CITI completion report, listing the training modules you completed, with dates and scores.
- Your CITI training is out of date.
- You are a student, postdoc, intern, or trainee, but did not list your supervisor (a faculty member or someone with a senior research appointment at your institution) as reference.
- Your research summary did not include sufficient information, or was in some other way inadequate.

{% if comments %}

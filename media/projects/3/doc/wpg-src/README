This directory contains the TeX (texinfo) source for the WFDB Programmer's
Guide.  Under Unix, Linux, or under MS-Windows with the Cygwin toolkit,
this guide can be printed or installed on-line by following the instructions
in `Makefile', provided that you have the necessary formatting software.
Here is a brief list of available formats and the commands needed to produce
them:

WFDB Programmer's Guide
  printed copy	'make wpg-book'(requires troff, texi2dvi, dvips, and a printer)
  Windows help	'make wpg.hlp' (requires makertf and hcrtf)
  HTML		'make wpg.html'(requires texi2html and perl)
  info		'make wpg.info'(requires makeinfo or GNU emacs)
  PDF		'make wpg.pdf' (requires texi2dvi)
  PostScript	'make wpg.ps'  (requires texi2dvi and dvips)

All of these, with the exception of printed copies, can be downloaded from
PhysioNet (look in http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).

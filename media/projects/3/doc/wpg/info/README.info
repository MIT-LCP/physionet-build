File: README.info

These files were generated using 'makeinfo' from the texinfo source for the
WFDB Programmer's Guide (wpg.tex, included in the WFDB Software Package).

Once installed, you will be able to browse the info files (those named 'wpg',
'wpg-1', 'wpg-2', etc.) in this directory using any of several info browsers.
To install the info files:

1. Install at least one of GNU emacs, XEmacs, or GNU info (free, from
   http://www.gnu.org/) if you have not already done so.

2. Locate your 'info' directory, which may be any of:
	/usr/info
	/usr/local/info
	/usr/share/info
   or, in some older installations:
	/usr/local/emacs/info

   Within emacs, you can locate your info directory with the sequence
	C-h C-i C-x C-f
   which will display the directory name in the minibuffer.

3. Copy the files in this directory (excluding this README) into your 'info'
   directory.

4. Finally, add a link to these files from the top of the 'info' tree.
   There are two ways to do this:

   * Look for the 'install-info' utility (if it's not in your PATH, look in
     /sbin/ or /usr/sbin/).  If you have it, add the link this way:
	install-info --info-dir=/usr/info wpg
     (replace /usr/info as appropriate for your system).

   * If you don't have 'install-info', copy the last line below (do not
     reformat it) and append it to the end of the 'dir' file you will find in
     your 'info' directory.

---------------- cut and paste the last line below into 'dir' -----------------

* WFDB library: (wpg).	The Waveform Database library.

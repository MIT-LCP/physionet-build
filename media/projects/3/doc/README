file: README		G. Moody	7 September 1989
			Last revised:	26 February 2006

This directory and its subdirectories contain documentation for the WFDB
Software Package, including UNIX man pages in troff source format for the WFDB
software and other sources for the WFDB Applications Guide (in wag-src), the
TeX (texinfo) source for the WFDB Programmer's Guide (in wpg-src), and the
LaTeX source for the WAVE User's Guide (in wug-src).  Under Unix, Linux, or
under MS-Windows with the Cygwin toolkit, this material can be printed or
installed on-line by following the instructions in `Makefile'.

If you follow the instructions for a standard installation of the WFDB Software
Package, the man pages from the wag-src subdirectory will be installed so they
can be read using 'man', 'xman', etc.  If you have the necessary formatting
software, these man pages and a large amount of other documentation can be
produced in a wide variety of formats from the sources in in this directory
(see 'Makefile').  Here is a brief list of available formats and the commands
needed to produce them:

WFDB Applications Guide
  printed copy	'make wag-book'(requires troff, tbl, latex, dvips, & a printer)
  HTML		'make wag.html'(requires rman, latex2html, and perl)
  man pages	'make wag.man'
  PDF		'make wag.pdf' (requires troff, tbl, latex, dvips, and pstopdf)
  PostScript	'make wag.ps'  (requires troff, tbl, latex, and dvips)

WFDB Programmer's Guide
  printed copy	'make wpg-book'(requires troff, texi2dvi, dvips, and a printer)
  Windows help	'make wpg.hlp' (requires makertf and hcrtf)
  HTML		'make wpg.html'(requires texi2html and perl)
  info		'make wpg.info'(requires makeinfo or GNU emacs)
  PDF		'make wpg.pdf' (requires texi2dvi) *
  PostScript	'make wpg.ps'  (requires texi2dvi and dvips)

WAVE User's Guide
  printed copy	'make wug-book'(requires troff, latex, dvips, and a printer)
  HTML		'make wug.html'(requires latex2html and perl) **
  PDF		'make wug.pdf' (requires pdflatex)
  PostScript	'make wug.ps'  (requires latex and dvips)

All of these, with the exception of printed copies, can be downloaded from
PhysioNet (look in http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).

* Some recent versions of pdflatex (invoked by texi2dvi) do not handle cross-
  references properly.  If you encounter errors while attempting to make
  wpg.pdf, try replacing pdflatex's copy of texinfo.tex with a version dated
  June 2001 or later.  This problem occurs under Red Hat Linux 7.2.

** Recent versions of Red Hat Linux have included several different versions
  of latex2html and of the utilities it uses, with a variety of bugs in the
  image-generation process.  If some of the images generated using 'make
  wug.html' have a black border at the left and lower edges, replace
  /usr/bin/pstoimg with the version found in wug-src/wave/misc and try again.
  These problems occur under Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3.

Under Fedora Core 4, most of the software needed to create the formatted
documentation is standard;  if 'yum' is correctly configured, you can install
latex2html and texi2html if they are missing using the command (as root):
	yum install latex2html texi2html

The following files will be found in this directory:

Makefile	UNIX `make' description file for printing the WFDB software
		 documentation and installing it on-line
Makefile.top	Used by ../configure to construct Makefile (comments only)
Makefile.tpl	Used by ../configure to construct Makefile (portable section)
README		this file

misc/		miscellaneous files for preparing formatted documentation
wag/		formatted versions of the WFDB Applications Guide [*]
wpg/		formatted versions of the WFDB Programmer's Guide [*]
wug/		formatted versions of the WAVE User's Guide [*]
wag-src/	sources for the WFDB Applications Guide
wpg-src/	sources for the WFDB Programmer's Guide
wug-src/	sources for the WAVE User's Guide

[*] These directories are empty in all distributed versions of the WFDB
    Software Package. Their contents can be generated using 'make all' in
    wag-src, wpg-src, and wug-src;  or the files may be downloaded from

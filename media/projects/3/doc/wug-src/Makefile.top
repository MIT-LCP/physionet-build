# This file is used with the UNIX `make' command to create and install on-line
# versions of the WAVE User's Guide, and also to print it.  Before using this
# file for the first time, check that the site-specific variables below are
# appropriate for your system.

# The WAVE User's Guide includes a comprehensive tutorial, with reference
# material, for WAVE, an interactive waveform browser with facilities for
# annotation editing and control of external analysis programs.  The WAVE
# User's Guide documents the original version of WAVE, which has an XView
# (Open Look) GUI and runs on PCs under Linux, and on SPARC-based systems
# under SunOS or Solaris.  A beta version of WAVE with a GTK+ GUI runs under
# Linux and under MS-Windows and is similar enough to the original WAVE that
# the WAVE User's Guide can be used for reference;  for further information,
# search for GTKWave on PhysioNet.

# The most recent version of this guide is always available on PhysioNet
# (follow the links from http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).
# Use any web browser to read it.

# If you have the necessary formatting software, the WAVE User's Guide can be
# produced in a wide variety of formats from the sources in in this directory.
# Here is a brief list of available formats and the commands needed to produce
# them:

# printed copy	'make wug-book' (requires troff, latex, dvips, and a printer)
# HTML		'make wug.html' (requires latex2html and perl)
# PDF		'make wug.pdf'  (requires pdflatex)
# PostScript	'make wug.ps'   (requires latex and dvips)

This directory contains the LaTeX source for the WAVE User's Guide.  Under
Unix, Linux, or under MS-Windows with the Cygwin toolkit, this material can be
printed or installed on-line by following the instructions in `Makefile', if
you have the necessary formatting software.  Here is a brief list of available
formats and the commands needed to produce them:

  printed copy	'make wug'      (requires troff, latex, dvips, and a printer)
  HTML		'make wug.html' (requires latex2html and perl)
  PDF		'make wug.pdf'  (requires pdflatex)
  PostScript	'make wug.ps'   (requires latex and dvips)

All of these, with the exception of printed copies, can be downloaded from
PhysioNet (look in http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).


The following files will be found in this directory:

.latex2html-init  Customized startup file for converting the WAVE User's Guide

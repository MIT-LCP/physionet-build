.SH NAME
lwcat \- postprocess output of plt to make PostScript, EPS, PDF or PNG
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplt -T lw\fR ... \fB| lwcat\fR [ \fIoptions ...\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBlwcat\fR collects the PostScript output of \fBplt\fR(1) and adds a prolog
and epilog to create a complete PostScript document (or another format, if
appropriate options have been selected).  It is possible to concatenate
the outputs of two or more \fBplt\fR runs to be processed as a single
job by \fBlwcat\fR;  see the \fIplt Tutorial and Cookbook\fR for details.
.SS Output format
.PP
By default, \fBlwcat\fR sends its output directly to the default printer
via \fBlpr\fR.  These options may be used to modify this behavior:
.TP
\fB-no\fR
Send the output to the printer, but don't eject the page (use this option
if you wish to overlay the output with additional material to be produced by
another program).
.TP
\fB-ps\fR
Write PostScript to the standard output (not to the printer).
.TP
\fB-psv\fR
Write PostScript to a temporary file and view it with \fBgv\fR (ghostscript).
.TP
\fB-gv\fR
Same as \fB-psv\fR.
.TP
\fB-eps\fR
Write EPSF (encapsulated PostScript format) to the standard output.  Note
that this is only a close approximation to EPSF;  it is acceptable to LaTeX's
epsfig package, at least.
.TP
\fB-pdf\fR
Write PDF (portable document format) to the standard output.
.TP
\fB-png\fR
Write PNG (portable network graphics) format to the standard output.

.SS Window options
.PP
By default, the output appears within a 6.75x6 inch (171x152 mm) window,
the lower left corner of which is positioned 1 inch (25.4 mm) from the
left edge and 3.5 inches (89 mm) from the bottom edge of the page.  The
following options may be used to modify the size, location, and orientation
of the output:
.TP
\fB-landscape\fR
Use landscape mode (rotate plot 90 degrees counterclockwise).
.TP
\fB-sq\fR
Plot in a 6x6 inch (152x152 mm) square window, 1.25 inches (32 mm) from the
left edge and 3.5 inches (89 mm) from the bottom edge of the page.
.TP
\fB-t\fR
Plot in a 6.25x6.25 inch (159x159 mm) square window, positioned as for
\fB-sq\fR.
.TP
\fB-t2\fR
Plot in a 6.25x4 inch (159x102 mm) window, positioned as for \fB-sq\fR.
.TP
\fB-CinC\fR
Plot in a 4.75x3.15 inch (121x80 mm) window, positioned as for \fB-sq\fR.
.TP
\fB-sq2\fR
Plot in a 4.5x5.5 inch (114x140 mm) window, 2.5 inches (63 mm) from the left
and bottom edges of the page.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Plot in a 7x9.5 inch (178x241 mm) window, 0.75 inches (19 mm) from the left
and bottom edges of the page (centered on a US letter sheet).
.TP
\fB-v2\fR
Plot in a 7x8.5 inch (178x216 mm) window, positioned as for \fB-v\fR.
.TP
\fB-va4\fR
Plot in a 190x275 mm window, centered on an A4 sheet.
.TP
\fB-full\fR
Plot in a 7.5x10 inch (191x254 mm) window, centered on a US letter sheet.
.TP
\fB-slide\fR
Plot in a 7.5x5 inch (191x127 mm) window, 0.5 inches (12.7 mm) from the left
edge and 3 inches (76 mm) from the bottom edge of the page (3:2 aspect ratio,
as for 35 mm slides).
.TP
\fB-screen\fR
Plot in a 7.5x5.625 inch (191x143 mm) window, 0.5 inches (12.7 mm) from the
left edge and 2.375 inches (60 mm) from the bottom edge of the page (4:3
screen aspect ratio).
.TP
\fB-golden\fR
Plot in a 7.5x4.635 inch (191x118 mm) window, 0.5 inches (12.7 mm) from the
left edge and 3.365 inches (85 mm) from the bottom edge of the page
(the aspect ratio is approximately the "golden ratio",
(1+sqrt(5))/2 = 1.61803 ...).
.TP
\fB-strip\fR
Plot in an 8x0.8 inch (203x20 mm) window.
.TP
\fB-custom\fR \fIwidth height left-margin bottom-margin font_scale\fR
Plot in a custom window. The \fB-custom\fR option reads up to 5
arguments that follow it.  If one of the 5 arguments immediately
following \fB-custom\fR begins with '\fB-\fR', it and any remaining
arguments are treated as ordinary options, and default values are used
for any missing options.  The units of width, height, and margins are
inches, and the font scale is a dimensionless factor with a default
value of 1 that can be used to enlarge or shrink any text in the plot.
The defaults for \fIwidth\fR and \fIleft-margin\fR are 5 and 0 respectively,
and the defaults for \fIheight\fR and \fIbottom-margin\fR are the values
assigned to \fIwidth\fR and \fIleft-margin\fR (whether explicitly or
by default).
        
.PP
Other window options can be easily added;  see the source for \fBlwcat\fR
for details.

.SS Copies
.PP
By default, \fBlwcat\fR prints a single copy.  Multiple copies can be
produced using the options \fB-c2\fR, \fB-c3\fR, \fB-c4\fR, \fB-c5\fR, and
\fB-c6\fR;  when using a PostScript printer, this will almost always be much
faster than rerunning \fBlwcat\fR, since the document is downloaded and
rasterized only once when using these options.  To print more than 6 copies,
repeat or combine these options as needed.

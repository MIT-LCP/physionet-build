.SH NAME
sampfreq \- show sampling frequency for a record
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsampfreq\fR [ \fIoption\fR ] \fIrecord \fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program shows the sampling frequency (in samples per second per signal)
for the specified \fIrecord\fR.  A record may contain multiple signals sampled
at different frequencies;  in this case, the signals are stored in \fIframes\fR
each containing at least one sample of each signal, and (by default, if no
\fIoption\fR is specified) \fBsampfreq\fR shows the number of frames per
second.  This is the number of samples per second returned for each signal
when the record is read using the WFDB library function \fBgetvec\fR
in standard (low-resolution) mode;  see \fBrdsamp\fR(1), for example.
.PP
If specified, the \fIoption\fR may be one of:
.TP
\fB-a\fR
List all signals in the record and their respective sampling frequencies.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print a usage summary.
.TP
\fB-H\fR
Show the highest frequency used for any signal in a multi-frequency record.
This is the number of samples per second returned by \fBgetvec\fR when the
record is read in high-resolution mode;  see \fBrdsamp\fR(1), for example.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
It may be necessary to set and export the shell variable \fBWFDB\fR (see
\fBsetwfdb\fR(1)).

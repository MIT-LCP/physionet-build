.TH WFDBMAP 1 "15 November 2011" "WFDB 10.5.10" "WFDB Applications Guide"
.SH NAME
wfdbmap \- make a synoptic map of a WFDB record
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwfdbmap -r\fR \fIrecord\fR [ \fB-a\fR \fIannotator \fR ...  ]
.br
\fBmap-record -r\fR \fIrecord\fR [ \fB-a\fR \fIannotator \fR ...  ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBwfdbmap\fR generates a shell script containing commands and embedded
data for creating a synoptic map of a WFDB-compatible \fIrecord\fR, optionally
including one or more associated sets of annotations (specified by one or more
\fIannotator\fR names following the \fB-a\fR option).  When the script is run,
it creates a PostScript-format 'map' of the WFDB record and its annotations,
using \fBlwplt\fR from the \fBplt\fR(1) package.  The maps displayed by the
PhysioBank ATM are created in this way, with an additional conversion of the
PostScript map to browser-compatible PNG format using \fBconvert\fR from
ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/).
.PP
\fBmap-record\fR is a shell script that illustrates how \fBwfdbmap\fR and
(indirectly) \fBplt\fR are used to create a map, and how to convert
the PostScript map into a PNG-format map using \fBconvert\fR.
.PP
For example, to make a map of mitdb/200 and its associated 'atr' annotations,
run the command:
.IP
\fBmap-record mitdb/200 -a atr\fR
.PP
The outputs of this command are \fB200.ps\fR and \fB200.png\fR.  If other
annotation files are available, their annotator names can be given as
additional command-line arguments:
.IP
\fBmap-record \fIrecord\fB -a \fIann1 ann2 ann3 ...
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
It may be necessary to set and export the shell variable \fBWFDB\fR (see
\fBsetwfdb\fR(1)).

This directory contains UNIX man pages in troff source format for the WFDB
software and other sources for the WFDB Applications Guide.  Under Unix, Linux,
or under MS-Windows with the Cygwin toolkit, this material can be printed or
installed on-line by following the instructions in `Makefile'.

If you follow the instructions for a standard installation of the WFDB Software
Package, the man pages from this directory will be installed so they can be
read using 'man', 'xman', etc.  If you have the necessary formatting software,
these man pages and the remainder of the WFDB Applications Guide can be
produced in a wide variety of formats from the sources in in this directory
(see 'Makefile').  Here is a brief list of available formats and the commands
needed to produce them:

  printed copy	'make wag-book'(requires troff, tbl, latex, dvips, & a printer)
  HTML		'make wag.html'(requires rman, latex2html, and perl)
  man pages	'make wag.man'
  PDF		'make wag.pdf' (requires troff, tbl, latex, dvips, and pstopdf)
  PostScript	'make wag.ps'  (requires troff, tbl, latex, and dvips)

All of these, with the exception of printed copies, can be downloaded from
PhysioNet (look in http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).

# This file is used with the UNIX `make' command to create and install on-line
# versions of the WFDB Applications Guide, and also to print it.  Before using
# this file for the first time, check that the site-specific variables below
# are appropriate for your system.

# The WFDB Applications Guide documents the application programs provided in
# the app, convert, psd, wave (briefly), and wview subdirectories of wfdb, as
# well as the file formats supported by the WFDB Software Package. It also
# includes a tutorial on evaluation of arrhythmia and ischemia detectors using
# this software and standard databases.

# The most recent version of this guide is always available on PhysioNet
# (follow the links from http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).
# Use any web browser to read it.

# If you follow the instructions for a standard installation of the WFDB
# Software Package, the man pages from this directory will be installed so they
# can be read using 'man', 'xman', etc.  The individual pages will be
# accessible to the UNIX `man' command, and to similar commands such as `xman',
# provided that MANDIR (see below) is in your MANPATH (type `man man' for
# further information).

# If you have the necessary formatting software, these man pages and the
# remainder of the WFDB Applications Guide can be produced in a wide variety of
# formats from the sources in in this directory.  Here is a brief list of
# available formats and the commands needed to produce them:

# HTML		'make wag.html'(requires rman, latex2html, and perl)
# man pages	'make wag.man'
# PDF		'make wag.pdf' (requires troff, tbl, pdflatex, ps2pdf, pdftk)
# PostScript	'make wag.ps'  (requires the above tools plus pdftops)
# printed copy	'make wag-book'(requires the above tools plus a printer)
